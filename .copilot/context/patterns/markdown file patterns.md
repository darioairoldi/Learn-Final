## Bullet Lists
when bullet lists are available as below

``` markdown
**What This Session Is NOT:**
- **Universal Microsoft Representation:** "This is not about all Microsoft developers. We are speaking only for the two of us"
- **Comprehensive Tool Coverage:** Not covering every AI feature in every development tool
- **Expert Proclamation:** "This is also not us proclaiming to be the experts on this stuff"
- **"Vibe Coding" Advocacy:** Not promoting speculative or experimental AI coding approaches
```

a blank line should be left before the list 

``` markdown
**What This Session Is NOT:**

- **Universal Microsoft Representation:** "This is not about all Microsoft developers. We are speaking only for the two of us"
```

otherwise Quarto would not render it properly
