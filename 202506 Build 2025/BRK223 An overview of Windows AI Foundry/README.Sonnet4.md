## Introduction: The Case for Local AI

**Timeframe:** 00:00:30 - 7m 15s  
**Speakers:** Tucker Burns, Dian Hartono

### Why Local AI Matters

Tucker Burns opens the session by establishing the fundamental premise that **we are at a turning point for local AI**. The presentation begins with a critical insight: running AI models exclusively in the cloud is not always optimal. With the miniaturization of AI models and advances in silicon capability, client-side AI processing has become increasingly viable and necessary.

The speakers identify four key drivers for local AI adoption:

#### 1. Compliance and Data Privacy

The evolving regulatory landscape presents specific challenges:

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** requirements for data sovereignty
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)** compliance in healthcare
- **DMA (Digital Markets Act)** data handling regulations
- **Complete data control** - models run without data ever leaving the device

#### 2. Performance and User Experience

Local processing offers significant advantages:

- **Zero network latency** - critical for real-time applications
- **Sensor proximity benefits** - audio, video, and input processing optimizations
- **High availability** - operations without internet dependency
- **Cost optimization** - reduced cloud infrastructure requirements

#### 3. Power Efficiency and Background Processing

Modern hardware enables new capabilities:

- **NPU utilization** - Neural Processing Units designed for efficient AI workloads
- **Proactive processing** - models running continuously without performance impact
- **New experience classes** - background AI capabilities enabling innovative features

#### 4. Hybrid Flexibility

The ultimate goal is flexibility between deployment models:

- Cloud-only applications for massive scale requirements
- Local-only applications for privacy and performance
- Hybrid approaches leveraging the best of both worlds

### Windows AI Foundry Platform Overview

Tucker Burns introduces Windows AI Foundry as Microsoft's comprehensive solution for local AI development. The platform is built on three foundational pillars:

```text
Windows AI Foundry Architecture
├── Windows AI APIs: Ready-to-use inbox models
├── Foundry Local: Open-source model catalog and execution
└── Windows ML: Foundation layer for custom models
```

This three-tier approach provides developers with complete flexibility in how they implement AI capabilities, from simple API calls to complex custom model deployment.

### Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enables models to ground their responses in private, local knowledge bases.

#### RAG Implementation Benefits
- **Semantic Search Powered** - Intelligent information retrieval from local data
- **Private Knowledge Grounding** - Answers based on proprietary documents and content
- **Dynamic Content Handling** - Real-time access to changing information
- **Multi-Modal Support** - Text, image, and document integration

### Live Demo: Fine-Tuning Workflow

Dian demonstrates the complete fine-tuning workflow using AI Toolkit for VS Code, focusing on a feedback categorization use case.

#### LoRA Training Process
1. **Project Creation** - Define fine-tuning objectives and model selection
2. **Dataset Preparation** - Training and test data for custom scenarios
3. **Azure Integration** - Cloud-based training with local model deployment
4. **Evaluation and Testing** - Quality assessment through AI Dev Gallery
