NOTE Confidence: 0.6770884990692139

00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.120
All right, all right, what's up y'all?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534634709358215

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.784
How many people were in Theatre A this morning when

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534634709358215

00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:08.000
I was out there emceeing?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8677780032157898

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.033
We had a great time and we made fun of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8677780032157898

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:11.239
Theatre B all morning.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5472733378410339

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.960
Great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8039553165435791

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.040
No, Theatre B is now my theatre.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8397275805473328

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.560
Theatre A is dead to me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8573393225669861

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.643
All right, now what I want to give you today

NOTE Confidence: 0.8573393225669861

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:23.067
are 4 prompts and prompt strategies that you can use

NOTE Confidence: 0.8573393225669861

00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:25.199
to become independently wealthy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9718843698501587

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.824
Not really, but they will make your life a little

NOTE Confidence: 0.9718843698501587

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:28.760
bit better, I think.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9521998763084412

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.588
And you can use these not just for programming, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.9521998763084412

00:00:31.643 --> 00:00:33.639
for whatever else it is that you do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8007431626319885

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.703
So we have here copilot, and we've got a couple

NOTE Confidence: 0.8007431626319885

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:41.120
of modes for copilot, ask, edit an agent.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9483625888824463

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.602
We've heard the word agent about 6,000,000 times in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9483625888824463

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:45.400
last 72 hours.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9350973963737488

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.960
So we're not going to do that at all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8680593967437744

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.606
I'm just going to hang out in agent mode and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8680593967437744

00:00:48.642 --> 00:00:49.960
we're going to do a little prompting.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7703279256820679

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.840
Now that's my timer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6669221520423889

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.600
Oh, it's already a minute.

NOTE Confidence: 0.755272626876831

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.280
It's already gone.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6084268689155579

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.480
All right, y'all lock in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9179792404174805

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.007
All right, so in this case, we have a project

NOTE Confidence: 0.9179792404174805

00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:01.953
where I've kind of started to build something, but there's

NOTE Confidence: 0.9179792404174805

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.501
no structure and it's like kind of looks like kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.9179792404174805

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.400
of a junk drawer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8952049016952515

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.903
And So what I like to do is use something

NOTE Confidence: 0.8952049016952515

00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:09.240
called the Q&A prompt.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9201034903526306

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.000
OK, And this is how it goes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9408483505249023

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.080
Hey there, how's it going?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9493981003761292

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.056
Listen up here, I got this project over here that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9493981003761292

00:01:18.113 --> 00:01:19.360
has like no structure.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9067496061325073

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.200
It's kind of a mess.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9520491361618042

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.652
And so I need like a recommended file or folder

NOTE Confidence: 0.9520491361618042

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:25.053
structure for this mug and I need you to give

NOTE Confidence: 0.9520491361618042

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:25.679
that to me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9624225497245789

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.990
But before you do that, could you please ask me

NOTE Confidence: 0.9624225497245789

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.251
5 yes or no questions that will help you make

NOTE Confidence: 0.9624225497245789

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.479
a better recommendation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6506778001785278

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.760
All right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9352542161941528

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.292
Now the first thing that I'll point out is that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9352542161941528

00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:38.640
I don't type to copilot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7602943778038025

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.480
I talk to it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9595633745193481

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.434
That's what you should do because you don't actually have

NOTE Confidence: 0.9595633745193481

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:41.559
to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7275810837745667

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.960
You don't have to be articulate, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9176753163337708

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.044
You can literally just like verbally vomit into the chat

NOTE Confidence: 0.9176753163337708

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:50.400
what you want and it will pull out from that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9170618057250977

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.320
The context here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831354558467865

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.627
All right, so it says, are you building a web

NOTE Confidence: 0.831354558467865

00:01:53.668 --> 00:01:55.079
application or bubble application?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9230464100837708

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.091
Doesn't doesn't know anything about our project right now, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.9230464100837708

00:01:58.138 --> 00:01:59.079
is super not useful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9643570184707642

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.760
So let's fix that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8304722905158997

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.361
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8304722905158997

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:04.086
clear the chat and I'm going to do the up

NOTE Confidence: 0.8304722905158997

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:05.359
arrow to bring my prompt back.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8902387022972107

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.148
And this time we're going to add in code base

NOTE Confidence: 0.8902387022972107

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.937
and code base is going to allow it to search

NOTE Confidence: 0.8902387022972107

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.160
my project for the files and folders that I've got.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8444218635559082

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.669
And then it's going to come back and it's going

NOTE Confidence: 0.8444218635559082

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.360
to ask, are you?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8792983889579773

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.988
Let's see, are you planning to follow a model view

NOTE Confidence: 0.8792983889579773

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:21.040
controller pattern?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8443378210067749

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.760
Yes, we need to handle authentication.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9487367272377014

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.480
Yes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9033822417259216

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.400
Do you plan to implement API endpoints?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5968068242073059

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.560
No, we use being automated tests.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8675521016120911

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.960
No, not testing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6710297465324402

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.760
You kidding me?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8508250713348389

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.800
Are you planning to include middleware?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8765431046485901

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.240
Yes, we are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9315201044082642

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.880
And then let's see what we get back.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7334308624267578

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.840
Oops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9087820053100586

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.096
We will not do that we will rerun without that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9087820053100586

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:48.453
let's try that again all right so based on that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9087820053100586

00:02:48.523 --> 00:02:52.159
it's going to give us a folder structure here right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696504235267639

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.110
So it looks like it's recommending A config controllers, middleware

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696504235267639

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:57.840
models, route services, types details like I don't know about

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696504235267639

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:00.394
y'all, but I really struggle with this stuff figuring out

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696504235267639

00:03:00.438 --> 00:03:02.816
how to structure my project right like if the template

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696504235267639

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.842
doesn't tell me I have a really hard time and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8696504235267639

00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:06.560
I always feel like I'm doing it wrong.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8430204391479492

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.040
So AI is really good at this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9400681853294373

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.074
So now what we want to do is we actually

NOTE Confidence: 0.9400681853294373

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:12.720
want to implement this and it can actually do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8331059217453003

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.720
It's actually giving us the code to create this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8922197222709656

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.265
Now I'm looking here, it looks like it's going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8922197222709656

00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:21.239
create the directories and the files.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8840906023979187

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.320
It's not quite what I want.

NOTE Confidence: 0.778511643409729

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.328
So let's vamp on this a little bit and be

NOTE Confidence: 0.778511643409729

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:26.639
like totes Magotes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6352612972259521

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.680
That is a dope structure.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9642930030822754

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.360
There's nothing about it that I don't love.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9653081297874451

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.600
I love everything about it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9427820444107056

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.209
Could you just give me a single script that will

NOTE Confidence: 0.9427820444107056

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:35.360
generate that structure?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8154469728469849

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.080
Don't create any of the files though.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9497475028038025

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.932
I just want the folders and then you can just

NOTE Confidence: 0.9497475028038025

00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:41.031
move the existing files that I have into the right

NOTE Confidence: 0.9497475028038025

00:03:41.073 --> 00:03:41.320
spots.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9504561424255371

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.880
Thanks.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9028893113136292

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.160
Now you can use agent mode to do this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8810659646987915

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.200
But in agent mode, agent mode doesn't delete files, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8736413717269897

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.000
It doesn't like to do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9137159585952759

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.749
It likes to create, it doesn't like to delete and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9137159585952759

00:03:53.805 --> 00:03:55.039
that's to to save you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7588866353034973

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.385
And so when we're in ask mode, we can get

NOTE Confidence: 0.7588866353034973

00:03:57.433 --> 00:03:58.239
a structure here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799639940261841

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.314
So we get a a script here and then we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799639940261841

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:04.387
can actually run this script and get it to create

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799639940261841

00:04:04.448 --> 00:04:06.600
our file and folder structure here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9563867449760437

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.695
So let's see, let's go ahead and add this into

NOTE Confidence: 0.9563867449760437

00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:10.440
a new file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9092704653739929

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.240
Let's see, let's save it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4929479956626892

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.840
Which we call it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8499236702919006

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.920
I don't know, we'll just call it script dot SH.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9078970551490784

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.720
That's a great name.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9590477347373962

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.560
And then let's run it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9117860198020935

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.760
And I'm not even going to think about that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8234652876853943

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.400
And I'm just going to run script dot SH, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8057296276092529

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.520
Why should I do it when you can do it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8420820236206055

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.440
All right, let's run it.

go that looks right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9048675298690796

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.931
Run Boom nailed it that's amazing see now I like

NOTE Confidence: 0.9048675298690796

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.565
the scripts like that because it just gives you more

NOTE Confidence: 0.9048675298690796

00:04:55.634 --> 00:04:57.760
control over what you're doing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.895531952381134

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.468
I like, I want to see it before you do

NOTE Confidence: 0.895531952381134

00:04:59.511 --> 00:04:59.640
it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9444083571434021

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.960
Don't do the thing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9225925803184509

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.840
I'll see it first.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9637414813041687

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.280
So that's how I like to roll.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9613001346588135

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.120
Now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9493911266326904

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.920
It didn't move the files that we had.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9631444811820984

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.360
We won't we won't get mad about that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852037787437439

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.840
But it got close enough.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8721884489059448

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.160
So that's called the Q&A.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9108507633209229

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.467
Just ask the model to ask you some questions like

NOTE Confidence: 0.9108507633209229

00:05:15.513 --> 00:05:17.920
it's prompting you and then you return the favorite.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9554092288017273

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.080
Now let's do another one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9519527554512024

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.720
Let's do the pros and cons for pros and cons.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8840194344520569

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.840
Let's take a look at this file here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9447372555732727

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.680
So this is our database connection file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7104284763336182

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.880
It's very complex.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9102929830551147

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.211
And what we want to do here is we want

NOTE Confidence: 0.9102929830551147

00:05:34.258 --> 00:05:36.737
to make sure that we're only injecting this one time

NOTE Confidence: 0.9102929830551147

00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:38.119
into the application, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9711874127388

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.160
So there's a lot of different ways to do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7691828012466431

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.960
In programming.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9068439602851868

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.537
There's never one right way to do anything, even though

NOTE Confidence: 0.9068439602851868

00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:45.552
you read a lot of blog posts that tell you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9068439602851868

00:05:45.598 --> 00:05:47.520
otherwise, there's not run one right way.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9492875933647156

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.080
You know this as developers, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.899971067905426

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.049
And so the model, though, is tuned to give you

NOTE Confidence: 0.899971067905426

00:05:52.114 --> 00:05:52.760
an answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9265515804290771

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.276
You asked a question, it gives you an answer, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.9265515804290771

00:05:55.327 --> 00:05:56.919
it may not be the right answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9629165530204773

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.440
And so it's better if you try something like this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5948381423950195

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.040
Sup bro, I'm back.

NOTE Confidence: 0.661422073841095

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.360
Yo, listen, new sitch here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.920909583568573

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.024
What's going on is I got a database file and

NOTE Confidence: 0.920909583568573

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:10.079
I want to just inject it once into the application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9294885993003845

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.897
Like I don't want to instantiate that mug every single

NOTE Confidence: 0.9294885993003845

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:13.679
time I use it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8907687664031982

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.720
What is the best way to do that?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9237257242202759

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.198
Actually give me several options and give me the pros

NOTE Confidence: 0.9237257242202759

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:19.040
and cons of each.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8655555844306946

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.440
All right, So we're simply asking the model for all

NOTE Confidence: 0.8655555844306946

00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:27.009
of the different ways that we could do this because

NOTE Confidence: 0.8655555844306946

00:06:27.058 --> 00:06:28.640
there's a lot of different ways.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8995709419250488

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.137
So it's telling us you can use the module level

NOTE Confidence: 0.8995709419250488

00:06:33.232 --> 00:06:38.400
Singleton pros, cons, OK, classical Singleton pattern.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9054952263832092

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.084
All right, That I actually like this better because this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9054952263832092

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.784
is not this is actually not a Singleton, I don't

NOTE Confidence: 0.9054952263832092

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.279
believe.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9367427229881287

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.861
All right, So, yeah, so in this case, what I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9367427229881287

00:06:50.934 --> 00:06:53.862
would now do is I would flip over to can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9367427229881287

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:55.400
I flip over to edit?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8319346308708191

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.560
I cannot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9027117490768433

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.194
I can flip over to agent, though, and I can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9027117490768433

00:07:01.294 --> 00:07:02.799
say dope sauce.

NOTE Confidence: 0.933491051197052

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.440
I like #2A whole lot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9496325254440308

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.560
Why don't you go ahead and implement that?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8995635509490967

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.545
And then you're going to need to update the places

NOTE Confidence: 0.8995635509490967

00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:11.411
in my project where this file is being used to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8995635509490967

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:12.999
make sure that everything is copacetic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9471763968467712

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.280
Thank you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7213796377182007

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.927
Go all right, you'll see how good speech recognition has

NOTE Confidence: 0.7213796377182007

00:07:19.028 --> 00:07:20.439
gotten lately.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9634508490562439

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.200
Like it's crazy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9268032312393188

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.877
That's a local speech model that runs on your machine,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9268032312393188

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.919
so it's like snappy and fast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7897844314575195

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.996
If you're not talking to a is, you should be

NOTE Confidence: 0.7897844314575195

00:07:30.055 --> 00:07:30.999
talking to a is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9054498076438904

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.720
It's a ton of fun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8435723781585693

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.964
All right, I see the database is only being used

NOTE Confidence: 0.8435723781585693

00:07:34.006 --> 00:07:34.800
in vehicle service.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9160124063491821

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.840
Yes, it's an oversimplified thing we got here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.835953950881958

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:39.200
So then it implements that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9762702584266663

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.520
I like that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.965316891670227

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.360
That's amazing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7936124205589294

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.880
Oh, we're still working.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9344072341918945

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.798
I can't keep until it's done and then it's going

NOTE Confidence: 0.9344072341918945

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.533
to update the vehicle service to use the correct database

NOTE Confidence: 0.9344072341918945

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:52.839
implementation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.852064311504364

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.440
All right, boom, here we are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9662138223648071

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.040
I love this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7566094994544983

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.480
Look at this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9711288213729858

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.240
I love this, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8830738067626953

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.468
And so just like that, we sort of done this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8830738067626953

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.215
refactor that we really, really like and we now have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8830738067626953

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:04.961
a Singleton and we're sure that it's only being used

NOTE Confidence: 0.8830738067626953

00:08:05.013 --> 00:08:05.480
one time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8254401683807373

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.680
So we're not newing this thing up multiple times.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9325061440467834

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.800
New is glue or something.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9735490679740906

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.200
I don't know.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9376615881919861

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.160
Steve Smith said that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9093911051750183

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.927
All right, let's keep all this let's let's leave this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9093911051750183

00:08:14.997 --> 00:08:17.600
file open and do some more fun stuff.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8316014409065247

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.086
So the next thing we're going to do is clear

NOTE Confidence: 0.8316014409065247

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.559
out the chat.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9262539148330688

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.389
You should be clearing the chat like all the time,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9262539148330688

00:08:22.446 --> 00:08:24.767
all the time all there we go So clear the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9262539148330688

00:08:24.823 --> 00:08:27.144
chat and you can see that I've got a file

NOTE Confidence: 0.9262539148330688

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.880
here, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8809133768081665

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.680
I've got this vehicle service file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9200668334960938

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.680
So I'm actually going to come back to ask mode.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7857436537742615

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.000
Let's come back to ask.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9201693534851074

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.155
Now the next thing I want to do is I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9201693534851074

00:08:35.205 --> 00:08:37.500
want to do a little bit of refactoring on this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9201693534851074

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.800
file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7842509746551514

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.200
I want to refactor, but the problem with the models

NOTE Confidence: 0.7842509746551514

00:08:40.247 --> 00:08:42.883
is that they like when you refactor, it's, it's, there's

NOTE Confidence: 0.7842509746551514

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.284
usually a lot of steps, like you're going back and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7842509746551514

00:08:45.331 --> 00:08:46.319
forth with the model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7931089401245117

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.200
It's like, I want to do this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8487308025360107

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.800
And you're like, Nah, not quite, let's try this instead.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9281121492385864

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.640
And the problem is that refactors are usually multiple steps.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9521842002868652

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.477
And the next step depends on what you just previously

NOTE Confidence: 0.9521842002868652

00:08:56.531 --> 00:08:57.119
did, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.943682074546814

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.120
And so the model tends to get confused.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9248837828636169

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.422
And so I want to teach you a trick to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9248837828636169

00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:03.599
make the model not do that, right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7742564082145691

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.520
And where's is Matt Pocock in the audience?

NOTE Confidence: 0.877060055732727

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.376
He came up with a name for this that we're

NOTE Confidence: 0.877060055732727

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.000
not going to use.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8187224864959717

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.720
It's called the Stepwise chain of thought.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9347371459007263

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.480
He had a different name.

NOTE Confidence: 0.893988311290741

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.360
Find him, ask him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9714757800102234

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.200
That was his idea.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8944742679595947

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.400
So this is what we're going to do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8533063530921936

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.520
Hey, listen, I want to refactor this file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9583941102027893

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.973
And what I want you to do is move one

NOTE Confidence: 0.9583941102027893

00:09:25.037 --> 00:09:26.000
step at a time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8901707530021667

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.997
So let's just move incrementally through this refactor and do

NOTE Confidence: 0.8901707530021667

00:09:30.059 --> 00:09:32.674
not move to the next step until I give you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8901707530021667

00:09:32.737 --> 00:09:33.919
the keyword banana.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8714843392372131

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:41.136
All right, so now we're going to get into this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8714843392372131

00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:43.079
refactoring loop, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8441450595855713

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.480
So we're going to refactor the code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8055824637413025

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.040
Oh, look, we have a sequel injection vulnerability.

NOTE Confidence: 0.934608519077301

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.880
Super.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9607437252998352

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.720
That's awesome.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9448745250701904

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.640
It's a great way to start, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6263521909713745

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.040
And then this change, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7017056941986084

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.127
And then it's looking at things once you use a

NOTE Confidence: 0.7017056941986084

00:09:54.172 --> 00:09:55.079
parameterized query.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9155791401863098

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.800
So here I might do something else, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672112226486206

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.800
I might say like parameterized queries are kind of clunky.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9275075197219849

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.120
Is there some other way that we can do this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7941486835479736

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.088
Should I be using an ORM or something, right, because

NOTE Confidence: 0.7941486835479736

00:10:06.144 --> 00:10:10.736
this is programming, you're investigating alternatives, you're doing these, you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.7941486835479736

00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:12.360
going back and forth, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.829352080821991

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.640
It recommends Prisma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9428912401199341

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.200
OK, very nice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7706248760223389

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.118
First you need to install Prisma, blah, blah, blah, blah,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7706248760223389

00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:17.320
blah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9335548877716064

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.324
And so then maybe we do this or maybe we

NOTE Confidence: 0.9335548877716064

00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:21.040
don't, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.912053108215332

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.297
It doesn't really matter, but what we can do from

NOTE Confidence: 0.912053108215332

00:10:23.343 --> 00:10:24.679
here, you see it says, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243269920349121

00:10:24.679 --> 00:10:27.568
So we can just tell it we can be like

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243269920349121

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:31.314
banana and it will just move directly on to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243269920349121

00:10:31.393 --> 00:10:35.295
next step of the refactor without, oh, it wants to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243269920349121

00:10:35.373 --> 00:10:40.291
let's start implementing Prisma because I guess that's the next

NOTE Confidence: 0.8243269920349121

00:10:40.369 --> 00:10:40.760
step.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8719878792762756

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.316
It's not going to let us move on until we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8719878792762756

00:10:42.354 --> 00:10:42.999
implement Prisma.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571902513504028

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.080
But you can use this stepwise.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8363890051841736

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.320
You always want to move in steps.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8949081897735596

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.074
Let the model work incrementally because a lot of times

NOTE Confidence: 0.8949081897735596

00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:50.839
it just you asked it to do something.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7958080768585205

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.186
So if you tell it to refactor something, it's going

NOTE Confidence: 0.7958080768585205

00:10:53.232 --> 00:10:54.520
to be like, cool, I got you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9028687477111816

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.471
And it's going to try to refactor the whole file

NOTE Confidence: 0.9028687477111816

00:10:56.512 --> 00:10:57.000
in one shot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.972549557685852

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.720
Don't do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118213057518005

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.867
Move incrementally and use a keyword that you don't use

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118213057518005

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:03.160
normally in code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8217718005180359

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.995
That's why I use banana just because I don't think

NOTE Confidence: 0.8217718005180359

00:11:05.032 --> 00:11:06.280
I've ever typed that word in code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9654846787452698

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.280
Maybe you have.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9235595464706421

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.280
That's interesting.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7894899845123291

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.476
All right, last one, this last one is called the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7894899845123291

00:11:12.542 --> 00:11:13.200
role play.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9235102534294128

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.800
Let's pop the chat out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8202816843986511

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.622
Did you know you all know you can do this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8202816843986511

00:11:16.662 --> 00:11:18.324
like you can get the chat out like this in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8202816843986511

00:11:18.364 --> 00:11:18.799
the editor.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7268056273460388

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.880
Look at this like full screen chat.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9597781896591187

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.200
Nice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8240256905555725

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.160
So here's what we want to do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9412113428115845

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.000
Models really, really, really like to role play.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9566497206687927

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.361
And what I mean by that is that if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9566497206687927

00:11:31.409 --> 00:11:34.510
tell them that they're good at something, they're just magically

NOTE Confidence: 0.9566497206687927

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:35.479
good at that thing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9247123003005981

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.720
It's amazing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8825601935386658

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.395
And that's why you always see in these prompts, they're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8825601935386658

00:11:39.442 --> 00:11:41.439
like, you are a skilled software developer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9641996622085571

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.800
They're not saying that just for fun, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9310926198959351

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.679
Like that is a key part of the thing actually

NOTE Confidence: 0.9310926198959351

00:11:47.743 --> 00:11:50.879
working, which is crazy, but that's how it works.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9667043685913086

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.360
And so let's do this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8964663743972778

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.960
You are the greatest instruction instructor in the world.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9143157005310059

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.240
You're almost as good as James Montemagno.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062146544456482

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.343
Not quite close, close to being as good as James

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062146544456482

00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:06.119
Montemagno.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9680584073066711

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.319
And the reason you're so good is that you give

NOTE Confidence: 0.9680584073066711

00:12:09.385 --> 00:12:13.217
your students creative exercises so that they can learn by

NOTE Confidence: 0.9680584073066711

00:12:13.283 --> 00:12:13.679
doing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9155290722846985

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.360
And your class is the most popular class in school.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9369903802871704

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.200
Everyone loves it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8948624730110168

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.600
And today you're teaching a class on regex.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9597417712211609

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.137
Go ahead and start the class, move one exercise at

NOTE Confidence: 0.9597417712211609

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.640
a time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824970722198486

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.075
And if the student gets the answer wrong, don't give

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824970722198486

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:30.229
them the answer, but go ahead and give them a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824970722198486

00:12:30.276 --> 00:12:33.039
suggestion that helps move them towards the correct answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144026637077332

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.524
And so in this way, right, you can turn the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144026637077332

00:12:39.594 --> 00:12:42.320
AI sort of into anything that you want.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062629342079163

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.610
So in this case, we're actually going to learn regex,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062629342079163

00:12:45.669 --> 00:12:48.643
which doesn't make a ton of sense because AI should

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062629342079163

00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:50.159
be writing all regex now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8882368803024292

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.480
But if we wanted to, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7763206958770752

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.120
We're here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9150855541229248

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.600
Phone number detection.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7151970863342285

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.040
Let's start.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8443320989608765

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.520
Let's see.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8322016596794128

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.360
I want you to write a regex pattern.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8164220452308655

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.806
So let's see here, exactly 3 digits, then a- And

NOTE Confidence: 0.8164220452308655

00:13:02.908 --> 00:13:05.679
I think this is just right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6473286151885986

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.160
Isn't that right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7945565581321716

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.649
That looks like the test string itself, not a regex

NOTE Confidence: 0.7945565581321716

00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:16.159
pattern.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7739699482917786

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.647
To create a right, we need to wrap it in

NOTE Confidence: 0.7739699482917786

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.880
a/ for digits, use the slash D So what is

NOTE Confidence: 0.7739699482917786

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:21.199
that?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9717614650726318

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.240
Like this and then this and then this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9182644486427307

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.920
I feel like this is a really hard first exercise.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7722674608230591

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.560
Should have said be be more simple.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7440125942230225

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.600
We're getting closer, all right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9340285658836365

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.042
So, but like with this, right, we could go through

NOTE Confidence: 0.9340285658836365

00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:42.778
here and we could actually learn anything that we want,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9340285658836365

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:43.119
right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.833797037601471

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.587
So if we wanted to learn Rust because we want

NOTE Confidence: 0.833797037601471

00:13:45.642 --> 00:13:48.164
to be super cool and we want people at parties

NOTE Confidence: 0.833797037601471

00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:50.522
to like us, we could do this right here in

NOTE Confidence: 0.833797037601471

00:13:50.577 --> 00:13:51.400
GitHub copilot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7727365493774414

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.750
So those are four prompt strategies, the Q&A prompt, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7727365493774414

00:13:56.834 --> 00:14:01.880
pros and cons prompts, the stepwise chain of thought prompt,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7727365493774414

00:14:01.964 --> 00:14:04.319
and finally the role prompt.

NOTE Confidence: 0.927643358707428

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.979
And remember, everyone is just one prompt away from being

NOTE Confidence: 0.927643358707428

00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:09.439
independently wealthy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9551568031311035
