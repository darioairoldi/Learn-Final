**David's Methodology:**
```
Prompt Pattern: "Give me approaches, not answers"
├── Problem Context: Pool with concurrent queue, no limits
├── Request: Four ways to free memory  
├── Evaluation: Read suggestions with domain expertise
├── Iteration: Follow-up questions on promising approaches
└── Implementation: Transform ideas into production-ready code
```

#### Stephen's Regex Optimization Journey
**Technical Challenge:** Improving .NET regex engine performance through literal optimizations.

### 📝 **2. Code Documentation and Maintenance**

#### Automated Comment Generation
**The Documentation Challenge:**
- **Legacy code understanding** - 20-year-old regex interpreter with cryptic opcodes
- **Comment debt** - 3,000 lines of undocumented C# code
- **Maintenance burden** - Who wants to write extensive documentation?

**AI-Powered Solutions:**

**Regex Interpreter Documentation:**
```csharp
// Before AI: "set counter null mark branch first for loop"
// After AI: "This implements a non-greedy branch for alternations and lazy quantifiers"
```

**Model Context Protocol Library:**
- **6,000 lines of AI-generated XML comments** - Reduced to 4,000 after human editing
- **Days of work compressed to hours** - From documentation creation to refinement
- **Context-aware generation** - AI understood method relationships and usage patterns

#### Table Generation and Technical Documentation
**Practical Automation Examples:**
- **XML table generation** from switch statement analysis
- **API documentation** with return type explanations
- **Cross-reference documentation** maintaining consistency across large codebases

### 💻 **3. Production Code Implementation**

#### LINQ Shuffle Method (.NET 10)
**Technical Innovation:** New randomization method for IEnumerable sequences.

**AI-Assisted Development Process:**
1. **Algorithm identification** - AI suggested reservoir sampling for `.Shuffle().Take()`
2. **Optimization discovery** - Hyper-geometric distribution for `.Shuffle().Take().Contains()`
3. **Performance validation** - 31μs → 4μs improvement with reduced allocations
4. **Code review assistance** - AI caught missing cast in probability calculations

**Real Performance Impact:**
```csharp
// Performance Results:
// Manual implementation: 31 microseconds
// Take() operator: 26 microseconds  
// Optimized Take().Contains(): 4 microseconds
// Allocation reduction: Significant memory savings
```
