**David's Methodology:**
```
Prompt Pattern: "Give me approaches, not answers"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Problem Context: Pool with concurrent queue, no limits
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Request: Four ways to free memory  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Evaluation: Read suggestions with domain expertise
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Iteration: Follow-up questions on promising approaches
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Implementation: Transform ideas into production-ready code
```

#### Stephen's Regex Optimization Journey

- **Comment debt** - 3,000 lines of undocumented C# code
- **Maintenance burden** - Who wants to write extensive documentation?

**AI-Powered Solutions:**

**Regex Interpreter Documentation:**
```csharp
// Before AI: "set counter null mark branch first for loop"
// After AI: "This implements a non-greedy branch for alternations and lazy quantifiers"
```

**Model Context Protocol Library:**
