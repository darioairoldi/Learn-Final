00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.280
Thank you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7371171712875366

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:00.920
Thank you very much.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557173013687134

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:01.560
Hello everybody.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9080782532691956

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.967
I am here to talk about C, but a new

NOTE Confidence: 0.9080782532691956

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.586
thing in C in particular, not just like language features,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9080782532691956

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:09.978
but a new way of running C So not that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9080782532691956

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.290
long ago, if you were teaching someone C, think about

NOTE Confidence: 0.9080782532691956

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:16.234
a new user, put yourself back when you were new

NOTE Confidence: 0.9080782532691956

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:19.792
to C and your first application might look something like

NOTE Confidence: 0.9080782532691956

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:20.160
this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8485166430473328

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.868
You would have gone to the command line type.net new

NOTE Confidence: 0.8485166430473328

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.159
console and then told them to open VS Code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9708672165870667

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.800
Or maybe you did.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9205997586250305

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.241
And then you're presented with this and it's like, OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9205997586250305

00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:28.920
I'm new to C#.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9556340575218201

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.480
I don't know anything about this language.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8976010084152222

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.400
And then I'm like, OK, what does this mean?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7854033708572388

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.960
And what is a namespace?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8115264177322388

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.840
And why don't I need a class thing?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9434141516685486

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.360
And what is that the name of the class?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8773255348205566

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.160
Or is that the keyword?

NOTE Confidence: 0.962730884552002

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.920
I don't really know.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9150596261024475

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.979
And then as I don't know what that is like,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9150596261024475

00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:43.938
that's just a whole bunch of words I've never heard

NOTE Confidence: 0.9150596261024475

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:44.239
before.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9498748779296875

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.680
I don't use in common language like static and void.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8316550850868225

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.560
What does void mean?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9738048315048218

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.240
I have no idea.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9148280024528503

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.250
And then finally, this looks like something that you might

NOTE Confidence: 0.9148280024528503

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:53.312
want to do as a first time developer, you know,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9148280024528503

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:55.502
print hello world to the console or to the command

NOTE Confidence: 0.9148280024528503

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:55.759
line.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111059308052063

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.967
So the code itself has a lot going on here

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111059308052063

00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:00.431
that isn't actually the code that you want to introduce

NOTE Confidence: 0.9111059308052063

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:02.279
people to when they're first starting C#.

NOTE Confidence: 0.855671226978302

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.714
Now, there are other files in here as well, like

NOTE Confidence: 0.855671226978302

00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:05.919
what's this CS project file?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8787099719047546

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.960
Oh my God, it's XML.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9064574837684631

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:09.548
Like why do I have XML in my new language

NOTE Confidence: 0.9064574837684631

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:12.642
experience that I am trying to teach you in this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9064574837684631

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.600
modern stack that's called C#.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118092060089111

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.239
And then lastly, there are these other folders that I'm

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118092060089111

00:01:17.282 --> 00:01:19.427
not really sure what they exist for, but they look

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118092060089111

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.200
kind of menacing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9536769390106201

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.207
If I open them, they have other things I've never

NOTE Confidence: 0.9536769390106201

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.560
heard of inside of them as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9308940768241882

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.200
So we can do better than this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9505031704902649

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.898
Like we wanted to make sure that we can simplify

NOTE Confidence: 0.9505031704902649

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:32.102
this experience for new people learning C# for the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.9505031704902649

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:32.439
time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8857107758522034

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.920
So in about.net six, we started making some changes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8728444576263428

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.380
And so now your new console app looks a bit

NOTE Confidence: 0.8728444576263428

00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:38.999
like this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.904726505279541

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.640
So I still have a bunch of files.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8195855617523193

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.579
I still have a file called program dot CS even

NOTE Confidence: 0.8195855617523193

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:47.237
though my app is called my first app dot CS

NOTE Confidence: 0.8195855617523193

00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:47.600
prod.

NOTE Confidence: 0.866385817527771

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.835
So I'm not really sure why, what programme is and

NOTE Confidence: 0.866385817527771

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:50.520
why it exists.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8802411556243896

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.929
But at least my programme dot CS is now just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8802411556243896

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.026
this one file that I want to show you as

NOTE Confidence: 0.8802411556243896

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:57.787
the first time C# developer look open this file, type

NOTE Confidence: 0.8802411556243896

00:01:57.838 --> 00:02:00.599
console dot writeline hello world and then you can run

NOTE Confidence: 0.8802411556243896

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.520
your application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9607610702514648

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.198
And obviously I still have this nasty looking XML as

NOTE Confidence: 0.9607610702514648

00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:04.479
well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.96709144115448

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.400
So what's really left here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9009196162223816

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.105
What if we could just get rid of all this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9009196162223816

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.470
stuff that isn't C# for the person who is starting

NOTE Confidence: 0.9009196162223816

00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:12.799
out?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9655506610870361

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.640
I'm starting from nothing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8372794985771179

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.935
And my first notch into learning C should just be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8372794985771179

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:18.600
C, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9394882321357727

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.640
It shouldn't be anything else.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9515555500984192

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.988
So if I go over to the console, I'm going

NOTE Confidence: 0.9515555500984192

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:23.720
to open up a new instance of code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9461030960083008

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.708
And so this is where I want to start a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9461030960083008

00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.480
nice blank slate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9155970215797424

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.280
And I'm just going to add my first C file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8846777677536011

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.252
So I'm going to call it hello dot CS because

NOTE Confidence: 0.8846777677536011

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:32.880
I'm learning.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8053693771362305

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.960
And so I'm going to print hello.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799815773963928

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.160
It's the first thing we do in new applications.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811854720115662

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.758
And so then I can tell the person, yeah, you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811854720115662

00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:41.599
going to write console dot writeline.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8112525343894958

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.240
Hello, C Great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.839314341545105

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.200
I've got C I'm just being exposed to CI.

NOTE Confidence: 0.940018355846405

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.702
Only have to learn about the concepts that I need

NOTE Confidence: 0.940018355846405

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:54.358
to accomplish the tasks that I'm trying to do right

NOTE Confidence: 0.940018355846405

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.452
now as a first time user, I have to call

NOTE Confidence: 0.940018355846405

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:59.363
this writeline method on this thing that says it's going

NOTE Confidence: 0.940018355846405

00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:00.639
to write to the console.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9652416706085205

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.880
So now I want to run this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9390908479690552

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.760
So OK, I'll come back to my terminal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9200268983840942

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.280
Let's go into this folder that I created.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8542503118515015

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.440
We'll clear it out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9013326168060303

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.200
Have a look inside.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9124377965927124

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.800
So here it is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.792624831199646

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.087
So now what if I could just.net run that file

NOTE Confidence: 0.792624831199646

00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:15.039
directly?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8830691576004028

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.527
Now this is the first time this is a brand

NOTE Confidence: 0.8830691576004028

00:03:17.586 --> 00:03:18.119
new feel.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6686482429504395

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.520
Look at that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.40196090936660767

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.760
It was.

NOTE Confidence: 0.33619192242622375

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.800
It looks like hello, see show.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8305374979972839

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.760
That's kind of cool right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9438995718955994

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.285
Now I know some of you are looking at that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9438995718955994

00:03:26.343 --> 00:03:28.520
and going why did it take 3.6 seconds?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8341701626777649

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.960
We're working on performance.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9355878829956055

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.520
This is literally the first version of this that works.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8814470171928406

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.760
Net 10 Preview 4 has this capability inside of it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9054701328277588

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.267
OK, and the version of VS Code I'm using the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9054701328277588

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.623
C extension that lights up the Intellisense when you're running

NOTE Confidence: 0.9054701328277588

00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:45.402
in this mode will be available imminently, if not by

NOTE Confidence: 0.9054701328277588

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:47.919
the end of the day, then hopefully by tomorrow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9366362690925598

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.480
OK, so now I can just directly run C#.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9019333124160767

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.908
If I run it again, it should be a bit

NOTE Confidence: 0.9019333124160767

00:03:51.942 --> 00:03:53.520
quicker because things should be a bit warmer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9525124430656433

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520
It's under a second now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9585800766944885

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.640
That's fantastic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8060729503631592

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.040
All right, well, what else can I do?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8859182596206665

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.786
Well, I might want to extend this to do more

NOTE Confidence: 0.8859182596206665

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.715
than just, you know, write the write out something to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8859182596206665

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:03.800
the to the console.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9568094611167908

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.400
What if I wanted to print out?

NOTE Confidence: 0.883319079875946

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.040
I don't know.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9569864273071289

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.560
How long has it been since build started?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7826263308525085

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.573
So we started what it was daytime offset dot, we'll

NOTE Confidence: 0.7826263308525085

00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:14.800
do dot pause and we started on what day.

NOTE Confidence: 0.838318943977356

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.000
Then you'll know the date was like 2025.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9465996026992798

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.505
Obviously we're in May and I think it was the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9465996026992798

00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:19.840
18th.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9567710757255554

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.360
Is that right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7313215732574463

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.920
1919.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6811981201171875

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.880
OK, apparently some I started on Sunday.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7452058792114258

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.214
I don't know about you all, but that's what we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7452058792114258

00:04:26.243 --> 00:04:26.359
did.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4699346423149109

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.640
All right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7988718152046204

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.680
So since again was going to be Yeah, that's right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8938680291175842

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.720
Thank you very much, copilot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9002992510795593

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.073
And then instead of printing that out, we're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9002992510795593

00:04:34.132 --> 00:04:36.775
go, OK, You know, it has been, I mean, that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.9002992510795593

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:39.301
not bad, but I'm just going to be lazy and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9002992510795593

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.240
I'm just going to do this right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.697127103805542

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.244
I'm just it is it is being that since build

NOTE Confidence: 0.697127103805542

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.200
started.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9085720181465149

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.720
OK, so I could go ahead and run that now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9215968251228333

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.842
So if I go and run that, see if I've

NOTE Confidence: 0.9215968251228333

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:54.850
made any mistakes and you know, it is factually or

NOTE Confidence: 0.9215968251228333

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.152
technically correct, which I'm told is the best kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9215968251228333

00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:01.159
correct, but it's not exactly very human friendly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9612117409706116

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.194
So I know that there's a package I could use

NOTE Confidence: 0.9612117409706116

00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:04.119
to make this nicer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8853467106819153

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.537
So how do I reference a package in this kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8853467106819153

00:05:06.592 --> 00:05:08.679
of new mode that I'm in with the file?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6927350163459778

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.622
Why can you introduce or use something called an ignored

NOTE Confidence: 0.6927350163459778

00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:12.199
directive?

NOTE Confidence: 0.864922821521759

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.252
So I mean the new version of C#, we taught

NOTE Confidence: 0.864922821521759

00:05:15.324 --> 00:05:16.560
C# as a language.

NOTE Confidence: 0.954647421836853

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.648
You've all seen like hash before, like hash if in

NOTE Confidence: 0.954647421836853

00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:22.697
your C# or like maybe some other types of hashes

NOTE Confidence: 0.954647421836853

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.319
in there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.860140860080719

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.410
Well, we told we told it about hash: And that

NOTE Confidence: 0.860140860080719

00:05:26.475 --> 00:05:28.559
means ignore this as a language.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9620471000671387

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.582
I don't want you to think about anything that happens

NOTE Confidence: 0.9620471000671387

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.039
after here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9468123912811279

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.440
And that's good for us as experienced developers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9701831936836243

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.080
We can build stuff on top of this now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9230951070785522

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.008
So I can say I want a package, and I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9230951070785522

00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:39.900
know there's a package called humanizer and I want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9230951070785522

00:05:39.954 --> 00:05:41.239
get it at version 2 dot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8701272010803223

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.680
I can't remember it's 2 dot something.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8065982460975647

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.960
So I'm just going to say 2 dot star.

NOTE Confidence: 0.47156959772109985

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.360
All right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9164409637451172

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.666
And now instead of doing that, I can say dot

NOTE Confidence: 0.9164409637451172

00:05:47.732 --> 00:05:50.440
humanize and I'm going to do it this way.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9551409482955933

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.760
So now let me go and run this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9173667430877686

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.119
Now it's doing the restore in the background for me,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9173667430877686

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.479
and I don't see any of that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8531221747398376

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.200
Oh, and I've got AI forgot to add a using.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9204790592193604

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.760
OK, so let me add my using.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9307989478111267

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.123
That's a new thing I need to think about as

NOTE Confidence: 0.9307989478111267

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:08.360
AC sharp developer after I've added this package.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8382954001426697

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.320
So good, good progressive disclosure.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9570955038070679

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.440
I'm learning the things I need to do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8662722110748291

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.556
OK, so now it has been two days since build

NOTE Confidence: 0.8662722110748291

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:13.999
started.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8994243144989014

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.690
So now I've seen I can have of just a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8994243144989014

00:06:16.763 --> 00:06:17.999
straight CS file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9543747305870056

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.926
I can reference a package if I need to, and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9543747305870056

00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.079
I can run that CS file directly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8487535119056702

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.400
All right, So what else can we do?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9621498584747314

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.640
This seems like a pretty good start.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8797126412391663

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.880
I'm going to jump over into Ubuntu on WSL.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7439531087875366

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.040
OK Anyone use WSL?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7746180295944214

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.880
Yeah, WSL rocks, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797833681106567

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.040
WSL is incredible.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9352741241455078

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.848
It's one of the best things that we've done in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9352741241455078

00:06:37.888 --> 00:06:38.360
a long time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.940990149974823

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.113
And I believe it got open source this week, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.940990149974823

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:41.079
is like super, super cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9481065273284912

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.120
OK, so I've got a couple of files here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8473179936408997

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.240
I've got a hello and I've got since.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8625151515007019

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.120
So if I look inside this hello file, all right,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8625151515007019

00:06:48.177 --> 00:06:50.915
it's just a more advanced version of what I just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8625151515007019

00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:51.600
showed you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8095618486404419

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.280
It says hello.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9631448984146118

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.480
It's been this long since build started.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9646827578544617

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.240
But look at this first line up here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8595500588417053

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.080
You see this line here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9494519233703613

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.040
That's called a shebang.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9030494093894958

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.280
Anyone ever seen a shebang?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8186049461364746

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.913
I see someone applauding silently over here, but like they

NOTE Confidence: 0.8186049461364746

00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:03.639
are applauding.

NOTE Confidence: 0.938112199306488

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.240
I see you, Sir.

NOTE Confidence: 0.671420156955719

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.120
I see you all right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9645294547080994

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.600
So what does that mean?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144628047943115

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.420
Well, in on Linux distros in these types of shells,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144628047943115

00:07:09.475 --> 00:07:11.632
you can put a hash bang at the front of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144628047943115

00:07:11.687 --> 00:07:14.120
your file as long as it's the first line and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144628047943115

00:07:14.175 --> 00:07:17.161
you remember not to use carriage return line feeds and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144628047943115

00:07:17.217 --> 00:07:19.650
you remember not to have a bomb in your file

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144628047943115

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.360
and all the other things that come with Windows.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9492968916893005

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.707
When you pull this your files over to Linux, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9492968916893005

00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:28.845
can point at what you want to use to execute

NOTE Confidence: 0.9492968916893005

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.240
this file directly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9374224543571472

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.301
So as long as this file is marked as executable,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9374224543571472

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:35.967
which is a Linux thing, not so much a Windows

NOTE Confidence: 0.9374224543571472

00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:38.574
thing, you can see up here the little X next

NOTE Confidence: 0.9374224543571472

00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:39.559
to hello dot CS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8474130630493164

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.000
That means this file is executable.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9174585342407227

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.240
I can just say, hey, look at that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9688576459884644

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.440
I can just run my CS file directly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9687947034835815

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.160
So what's in this other one?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9146133661270142

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.993
Just to underline that one, this is my more generic

NOTE Confidence: 0.9146133661270142

00:07:53.048 --> 00:07:54.159
version of this app.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9573001861572266

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.363
So I can like pass an argument in and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.9573001861572266

00:07:56.415 --> 00:07:57.360
it will calculate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8889068961143494

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.800
So you can see now I'm using bugs, new concept.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9380406737327576

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.741
I can introduce that now rather than having it be

NOTE Confidence: 0.9380406737327576

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.603
there in the beginning of the file that I have

NOTE Confidence: 0.9380406737327576

00:08:04.643 --> 00:08:04.960
to like.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6436821818351746

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.720
They ignore that part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9511921405792236

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.640
I'll get to that later.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9232522249221802

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.840
So how do I make this thing executable?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693543672561646

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.360
Well, I have to make it executable.

NOTE Confidence: 0.654961109161377

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.640
So I say schmod, schmod.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7469136714935303

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.583
You say schmod, chamard, chamard, and I say plus executable

NOTE Confidence: 0.7469136714935303

00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:22.812
bit since that's CS now in theory, I can just

NOTE Confidence: 0.7469136714935303

00:08:22.904 --> 00:08:23.640
execute.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9041492342948914

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.960
Oh, it says I need to provide a date.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8627853393554688

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.200
Good.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799691796302795

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.020
So I'll put my birthday in probably a bad idea,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799691796302795

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.880
but you know, Oh no, not 1780.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9339277744293213

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.160
I am a vampire.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9700314402580261

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.440
I just didn't tell any of you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9396018385887146

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.651
And this will tell me how old I am Yes,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9396018385887146

00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:37.240
I am actually 47 years old.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058305025100708

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.501
So this is we think a kind of cool thing

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058305025100708

00:08:39.557 --> 00:08:42.384
we now if you're living in the Linux ecosystem, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058305025100708

00:08:42.441 --> 00:08:45.889
support these types of, you know, shell execute constructs so

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058305025100708

00:08:45.946 --> 00:08:48.490
that you can get the advantage of that on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9058305025100708

00:08:48.546 --> 00:08:49.959
system that you're using.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8817289471626282

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.195
All right, So what else can you kind of do

NOTE Confidence: 0.8817289471626282

00:08:52.246 --> 00:08:52.759
with this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9259355664253235

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.331
Well, first of all, let me just quickly compare like

NOTE Confidence: 0.9259355664253235

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.556
one of the reasons like I kind of get making

NOTE Confidence: 0.9259355664253235

00:08:57.605 --> 00:08:59.040
things simpler for new users.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9605165123939514

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.240
It's not just about that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8673201203346252

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:03.327
Who here has ever ridden a Node application or a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8673201203346252

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:04.479
Python application?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9316422343254089

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.480
OK, this isn't new, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8423140048980713

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.644
If I'm over in Nodeland and I've got this hello

NOTE Confidence: 0.8423140048980713

00:09:09.711 --> 00:09:10.519
dot JS file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8600811958312988

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.479
But if I actually, I keep typing CS when I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8600811958312988

00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:13.599
mean to type JS, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7798672914505005

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.920
How do you run this over in Node land?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8072957396507263

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.094
You do Node hello dot JS, like that's how it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8072957396507263

00:09:18.143 --> 00:09:18.439
works.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9381095170974731

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.720
How does it work in Python?

NOTE Confidence: 0.892935574054718

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.379
You say π or Python or Python 3 or whatever

NOTE Confidence: 0.892935574054718

00:09:22.439 --> 00:09:23.639
launch you're using.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9435063004493713

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.766
And then the Python file, even Go has a facility

NOTE Confidence: 0.9435063004493713

00:09:26.826 --> 00:09:27.360
for this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9506130218505859

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.992
Even Rust has a facility for doing this type of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9506130218505859

00:09:30.048 --> 00:09:31.560
just run the file directly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9355480074882507

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.060
So we were kind of lagging behind, but I'm very

NOTE Confidence: 0.9355480074882507

00:09:34.109 --> 00:09:36.400
happy to say that we're catching up in.net 10.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9237506985664368

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.760
OK, What about more complicated applications?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9551287293434143

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.979
Let me move over now to something that isn't just

NOTE Confidence: 0.9551287293434143

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:43.399
hello.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9612822532653809

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.120
What if I want to do a web application?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9354114532470703

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.236
What other type of things would we have to support

NOTE Confidence: 0.9354114532470703

00:09:47.278 --> 00:09:48.760
to let you build a web application?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9241259694099426

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.798
Well, here's a Web API expressed as a single file

NOTE Confidence: 0.9241259694099426

00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:54.200
with no project.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8295000195503235

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.600
So I've got my hash bang.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9455209970474243

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.080
This does nothing on Windows.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8284028768539429

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.160
All right, maybe one day, but not today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9378719925880432

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.440
So I can set the SDK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8822991251945496

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.880
So web projects use a different SDK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7270066142082214

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.998
OK, an SDK is like a collection of packages, a

NOTE Confidence: 0.7270066142082214

00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:09.039
name is build goop and a whole bunch of magic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8579773306846619

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.181
So we say, OK, I need to use the Web

NOTE Confidence: 0.8579773306846619

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:11.439
SDK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93904709815979

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.367
I can add a reference to a package just like

NOTE Confidence: 0.93904709815979

00:10:13.406 --> 00:10:13.759
I showed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9423714280128479

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.333
And then I can just write out my web application

NOTE Confidence: 0.9423714280128479

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:17.159
as you see here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118791222572327

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.760
So let me see if this actually runs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9160718321800232

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.560
See if I'm lying.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7678349018096924

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.280
I'm in here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8865624070167542

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.992
I'm going to go into Web API, let's do net

NOTE Confidence: 0.8865624070167542

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.760
run Web API dot CS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9655029773712158

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.720
And I've done everything correctly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9292371273040771

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.800
I didn't break it earlier.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9156048893928528

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.312
This should boot up my Web API listening on There

NOTE Confidence: 0.9156048893928528

00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:36.880
it is on localhost 5000.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7771058678627014

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.360
I can control.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9242790937423706

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.739
Click on that and there's my web application running on

NOTE Confidence: 0.9242790937423706

00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:41.599
the defaults.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9282867908477783

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.560
Nice, nice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7732657194137573

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.680
OK, OK, well, that's a, that's a really good start.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8307411670684814

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.440
I think, you know, we're getting somewhere here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9543156027793884

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.240
What else can we possibly do here to show you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9543156027793884

00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:54.520
some other stuff?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8830889463424683

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.240
I'm going to quickly jump back to my.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8930249810218811

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.680
Where is it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.827491819858551

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.080
Here it is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5932624936103821

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.520
Nope.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8335262537002563

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.000
That one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8572107553482056

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.951
All right, Want to make sure I show all the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8572107553482056

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.159
stuff that I wanted to show.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9593259692192078

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.440
Yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8771737813949585

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.545
All right, so let's show you some stuff that I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8771737813949585

00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:06.559
wasn't planning on showing because why not?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9017947912216187

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.800
So I'm going to go back to this Web API.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8740924000740051

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.560
So I showed you a Web API.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8428468108177185

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.480
What about a Razor app?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9088923931121826

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.234
So what would a Razor app look like in this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9088923931121826

00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:14.519
world?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7909591794013977

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.668
So this is a Blazer server side or Blazer static

NOTE Confidence: 0.7909591794013977

00:11:17.734 --> 00:11:19.440
server side rendering app.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8124361634254456

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.594
Over here I've got a Razor app folder and I've

NOTE Confidence: 0.8124361634254456

00:11:21.641 --> 00:11:23.000
got my Razor app dot CS file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8702462315559387

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.000
What does it look like?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8653891086578369

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.006
Well, it looks like a web application, doesn't really look

NOTE Confidence: 0.8653891086578369

00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:26.560
that different.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8481272459030151

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.063
I'm bringing the the web SDK, but because it's a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8481272459030151

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:32.747
web app, I can just have Razor files next to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8481272459030151

00:11:32.807 --> 00:11:34.000
my entry point file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8965104818344116

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.720
We call this the entry point filelikeyousay.net run this file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9247615933418274

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.920
That's your entry point file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9770017862319946

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.240
This will just work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9675706624984741

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.422
So if you want to continue teaching this person more

NOTE Confidence: 0.9675706624984741

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.922
about what they can do with C#, you can do

NOTE Confidence: 0.9675706624984741

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.480
that before you introduce them to projects.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9342314600944519

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.788
But at some point you're going to want a project

NOTE Confidence: 0.9342314600944519

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:52.839
probably for a lot of the stuff that you do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9525067806243896

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.051
We all, a lot of us, I'm assuming, work in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9525067806243896

00:11:55.092 --> 00:11:57.236
Visual Studio or we work with solutions with lots of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9525067806243896

00:11:57.277 --> 00:11:58.719
projects that reference each other.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9467800259590149

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.897
You get to a point where you need the flexibility,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9467800259590149

00:12:01.954 --> 00:12:04.639
you need the capabilities that projects afford.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9496362805366516

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.480
But we don't leave you in the lurch.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8615061640739441

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.705
We haven't like built an alternate universe where once you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8615061640739441

00:12:08.744 --> 00:12:10.586
get to this point, you go, well, you're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8615061640739441

00:12:10.624 --> 00:12:12.236
have to walk back a few steps now and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8615061640739441

00:12:12.274 --> 00:12:14.040
I'm going to have to teach you about projects.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9672184586524963

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.622
No, you can just jump straight into the world of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9672184586524963

00:12:16.675 --> 00:12:17.159
projects.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9648411273956299

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.840
So let's go over to my app.

NOTE Confidence: 0.868582010269165

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.657
So I'm in my New Hope folder where I created

NOTE Confidence: 0.868582010269165

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:22.360
my Hello dot CS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9143113493919373

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.437
And when I am ready good and ready to move

NOTE Confidence: 0.9143113493919373

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.320
to projectsicansay.net project convert Hello dot CS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8753898739814758

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.665
And now just like that, if I look inside, I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8753898739814758

00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:34.399
don't have a hello dot CS file anymore.

NOTE Confidence: 0.954070508480072

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.083
I have a hello folder and if I open that

NOTE Confidence: 0.954070508480072

00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:42.320
folder, you'll see that now I have a project.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9053484201431274

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.719
So it took my package reference and it expanded it

NOTE Confidence: 0.9053484201431274

00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:48.983
out into what it should be inside a project, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.9053484201431274

00:12:49.047 --> 00:12:50.839
is a package reference item.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8244882822036743

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.887
If I go into my hello dot CS file, there's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8244882822036743

00:12:52.936 --> 00:12:53.960
my hello dot CS file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8586520552635193

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.680
It's stripped out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.818852424621582

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.640
Those ignore directives because now I'm in project mode.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9358367323875427

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.119
I use the project way of doing things, which is

NOTE Confidence: 0.9358367323875427

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:01.719
referencing things via packages.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9531566500663757

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.246
But now it works the same way you would expect

NOTE Confidence: 0.9531566500663757

00:13:04.296 --> 00:13:04.599
today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.862518310546875

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.794
So now you can teach the person all right, now

NOTE Confidence: 0.862518310546875

00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:09.227
that you're in project land over for your wait for

NOTE Confidence: 0.862518310546875

00:13:09.274 --> 00:13:11.707
your terminal, and then you just run the project in

NOTE Confidence: 0.862518310546875

00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:12.280
the folder.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9065563082695007

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.975
It finds the project, it builds it, and it runs

NOTE Confidence: 0.9065563082695007

00:13:14.011 --> 00:13:14.119
it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9530371427536011

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.751
OK, So now we have this nice smooth, gradual learning

NOTE Confidence: 0.9530371427536011

00:13:17.815 --> 00:13:20.759
arc where you can start from a single CS file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9063490629196167

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.560
Do your console dot hello.

NOTE Confidence: 0.49341094493865967

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.920
Once at the writeline, hello dot CS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8938077688217163

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.071
You can add packages, reference those, use those APIs in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8938077688217163

00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:28.440
there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9638307690620422

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.120
You can even build web applications.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8997295498847961

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.146
If you're in the world of Linux, you can take

NOTE Confidence: 0.8997295498847961

00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:34.520
advantage of shell execution over there with hash bang.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9260269999504089

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.486
And then when you're ready, you can introduce them to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9260269999504089

00:13:37.537 --> 00:13:40.679
projects by converting what the work they've done already into

NOTE Confidence: 0.9260269999504089

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.909
a project so that they can now party in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9260269999504089

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.748
world of projects and solutions with the big kids using

NOTE Confidence: 0.9260269999504089

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:48.080
Visual Studio and solutions and all that fun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89493328332901

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.114
All right, so that's all I had to show you

NOTE Confidence: 0.89493328332901

00:13:50.149 --> 00:13:50.360
today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8956455588340759

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.764
What I want you all to do is you haven't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8956455588340759

00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:52.080
already.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7240846157073975

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.243
Godownand.goanddownload.net 10 Preview 4 Visual Studio Code, the C# extension

NOTE Confidence: 0.7240846157073975

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.920
of a Visual Studio Code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9719811081886292

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.240
That's this over here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9398108720779419

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.040
I'm using a build from like the GitHub repo yesterday.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9162567257881165

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.074
I'm told this will be released in the pre release

NOTE Confidence: 0.9162567257881165

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.109
channel for C# extension either like the end of today

NOTE Confidence: 0.9162567257881165

00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:09.840
or tomorrow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9151748418807983

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.872
Grab that as well and start playing around with this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9151748418807983

00:14:12.924 --> 00:14:15.740
and giving us feedback on the.net/SDK repo and so that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9151748418807983

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:18.870
we can incorporate that feedback into Preview 5 and Preview

NOTE Confidence: 0.9151748418807983

00:14:18.922 --> 00:14:20.799

NOTE Confidence: 0.9260221123695374

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.280
There it is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7531862854957581

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:22.760
Run file.

NOTE Confidence: 0.960645318031311
