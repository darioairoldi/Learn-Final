## 1. Introduction: The Developer Experience Problem

**Timeframe:** 00:00:00  
**Duration:** 1m 30s  
**Speaker:** Damian Edwards

Damian Edwards opened the session by highlighting a fundamental problem in C# developer onboarding: the overwhelming complexity of the initial experience for newcomers to the language. The session focused on a revolutionary new feature in .NET 10 that addresses this longstanding barrier to entry.

The core premise was that when teaching C# to new developers, the traditional approach required understanding numerous concepts unrelated to the actual C# language itself - project files, XML configuration, folder structures, and ceremonial code that obscured the learning objectives.

**Key Problem Statement:**
> *"I'm new to C#. I don't know anything about this language. And then I'm like, OK, what does this mean? And what is a namespace? And why don't I need a class thing?"* - Describing typical beginner confusion

The session aimed to demonstrate how .NET 10 eliminates these barriers through direct C# file execution capabilities.

## 2. The Traditional C# Learning Barrier

**Timeframe:** 00:00:40  
**Duration:** 2m 00s  
**Speaker:** Damian Edwards

### 2.1 Project Ceremony Complexity

Edwards illustrated the traditional new developer experience by showing what happened when someone ran `dotnet new console`:

**Traditional Console Application Structure:**
```csharp
namespace MyFirstApp;
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

**Associated Project Files:**
- `.csproj` file with XML configuration
- `bin/` and `obj/` directories with mysterious contents
- `Program.cs` file with confusing naming (why "Program" when the app is called "MyFirstApp"?)

### 2.2 Cognitive Overload for Beginners

The traditional approach presented numerous unfamiliar concepts simultaneously:

**Overwhelming Terminology:**
- **Namespace:** Unfamiliar concept requiring explanation
- **Class:** Object-oriented programming concept
- **Static:** Modifier with complex implications
- **Void:** Return type concept
- **Main:** Entry point convention
- **String[] args:** Command-line arguments array

**Non-Essential Complexity:**
- XML project files for simple scripts
- Hidden folder structures (`bin`, `obj`)
- Multiple files for single-purpose applications
- Separation between file names and application purpose

Edwards emphasized that these elements, while important for full application development, created unnecessary cognitive load for developers trying to learn basic C# syntax and concepts.

## 3. .NET 6 Progress: Top-Level Programs

**Timeframe:** 00:02:35  
**Duration:** 1m 00s  
**Speaker:** Damian Edwards

### 3.1 Code Simplification

.NET 6 introduced significant improvements through top-level programs, reducing the ceremonial code required:

**Simplified Console Application:**
```csharp
// Program.cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

This eliminated the namespace, class, and Main method ceremony, focusing on the actual functionality developers wanted to implement.

### 3.2 Remaining Challenges

Despite the code simplification, several barriers remained:

**Persistent Issues:**
- **Project Files:** Still required XML configuration files
- **File Naming Confusion:** `Program.cs` vs. actual application name
- **Project Structure:** Multiple files and directories for simple tasks
- **Ceremony Overhead:** XML and project configuration for basic scripting

Edwards noted that while the code became simpler, the overall development experience still included unnecessary complexity for newcomers focusing purely on learning C# language features.

## 4. .NET 10 Revolution: Direct File Execution

**Timeframe:** 00:03:00  
**Duration:** 2m 30s  
**Speaker:** Damian Edwards

### 4.1 Core Feature Demonstration

Edwards demonstrated the revolutionary capability of .NET 10 Preview 4:

**Pure C# File Creation:**
```csharp
// hello.cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello, C#!");
```

**Direct Execution:**
```bash
dotnet run hello.cs
# Output: Hello, C#!
```

**Key Innovation Points:**
- **Zero Ceremony:** No project files, XML, or additional structure required
- **Pure C# Learning:** Focus exclusively on language concepts
- **Immediate Feedback:** Write code and execute instantly
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Introduce complexity only when needed

### 4.2 Performance Characteristics

**Initial Performance Metrics:**
- **Cold Start:** ~3.6 seconds (first execution)
- **Warm Start:** <1 second (subsequent executions)
- **Performance Improvements:** Planned for Preview 5 and 6

Edwards acknowledged the current performance characteristics while emphasizing this was the first working implementation:

> *"This is literally the first version of this that works. .NET 10 Preview 4 has this capability inside of it."*

**Development Status:**
- Available in .NET 10 Preview 4
- VS Code C# extension support arriving within days of the session
- Performance optimizations planned for future previews

## 5. Package Management with Ignore Directives

**Timeframe:** 00:04:00  
**Duration:** 2m 30s  
**Speaker:** Damian Edwards

### 5.1 NuGet Package Integration

Edwards demonstrated how to add external packages using the new ignore directive system:

**Package Reference Syntax:**
```csharp
#r "nuget: Humanizer, 2.*"
using Humanizer;

var buildStart = new DateTimeOffset(2025, 5, 19, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero);
var timeSince = DateTimeOffset.Now - buildStart;

Console.WriteLine($"It has been {timeSince.Humanize()} since Build started.");
// Output: It has been 2 days since Build started.
```

**Ignore Directive (`#r`) Features:**
- **Language Instruction:** Tells C# compiler how to handle external references
- **Metadata Separation:** Keeps package information separate from actual C# code
- **Extensible System:** Foundation for additional directive types
- **Clean Code:** Maintains pure C# syntax in the main code body

### 5.2 Progressive Disclosure Learning

The package integration demonstrated progressive disclosure principles:

**Learning Progression:**
1. **Start Simple:** Pure C# syntax and basic operations
2. **Add Complexity:** Variable declarations, method calls, date operations
3. **Include External Code:** Package references and using statements
4. **Expand Functionality:** More sophisticated operations with external libraries

Edwards noted that the using statement introduction came naturally after adding packages:
> *"That's a new thing I need to think about as a C# developer after I've added this package. So good, good progressive disclosure. I'm learning the things I need to do."*

This approach allows developers to encounter concepts when they become relevant rather than overwhelming them upfront.

## 6. Cross-Platform Support: Linux and Shebang

**Timeframe:** 00:06:30  
**Duration:** 2m 00s  
**Speaker:** Damian Edwards

### 6.1 Shebang Implementation

Edwards demonstrated Linux integration by showing shebang support in .NET 10:

**Linux-Executable C# Script:**
```csharp
#!/usr/bin/env dotnet run
#r "nuget: Humanizer, 2.*"
using Humanizer;

var inputDate = DateTimeOffset.Parse(args[0]);
var age = DateTimeOffset.Now - inputDate;
Console.WriteLine($"You are {age.Humanize()} old.");
```

**Shebang Line Explanation:**
- **`#!/usr/bin/env dotnet run`:** Standard Unix/Linux executable specification
- **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Same experience across Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Shell Integration:** Direct execution from command line without explicit `dotnet run`

### 6.2 Executable Script Creation

**Linux Execution Process:**
```bash
# Make file executable
chmod +x script.cs

# Run directly
./script.cs "1978-01-01"
# Output: You are 47 years old.
```

**Cross-Platform Benefits:**
- **WSL Integration:** Seamless experience with Windows Subsystem for Linux
- **Container Support:** Works in Docker and containerized environments
- **DevOps Scripting:** Enables C# for automation and system administration tasks
- **Unified Experience:** Same file works on Windows and Linux with appropriate execution methods

Edwards highlighted this as bringing C# in line with other scripting languages:
> *"We were kind of lagging behind, but I'm very happy to say that we're catching up in .NET 10."*

## 7. Advanced Applications: Web APIs and Beyond

**Timeframe:** 00:08:30  
**Duration:** 2m 00s  
**Speaker:** Damian Edwards

### 7.1 Single-File Web API

Edwards demonstrated that the direct execution capability extends beyond simple console applications:

**Complete Web API in Single File:**
```csharp
#!/usr/bin/env dotnet run
#!set sdk Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web
#r "nuget: Swashbuckle.AspNetCore"

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!")
    .WithName("GetHelloWorld")
    .WithOpenApi();

app.Run();
```

**Advanced Capabilities Demonstrated:**
- **Full ASP.NET Core Support:** Complete web framework functionality
- **Swagger Integration:** Automatic API documentation generation
- **OpenAPI Support:** Modern API specification compliance

## 8. Project Conversion and Migration Path

**Timeframe:** 00:10:30  
**Duration:** 1m 30s  
**Speaker:** Damian Edwards

### 8.1 Seamless Project Creation

Edwards demonstrated the smooth migration path from single files to full projects:

**Project Conversion Command:**
```bash
dotnet project convert hello.cs
```

**Conversion Process:**
1. **Project Folder Creation:** Creates directory with same name as file
2. **`.csproj` Generation:** Automatic project file creation with appropriate references
3. **Directive Stripping:** Removes ignore directives from C# file
4. **Package Integration:** Converts `#r` directives to proper PackageReference elements
5. **Code Preservation:** Maintains all functionality in project format

### 8.2 Maintaining Functionality

**Before Conversion:**
```
hello.cs (standalone file with directives)
```

**After Conversion:**
```
hello/
├── hello.csproj
└── hello.cs (clean C# code)
```

**Benefits of Conversion:**
- **Full Tooling Support:** Complete Visual Studio and VS Code integration
- **Advanced Features:** MSBuild targets, custom build processes, multi-file projects
- **Team Development:** Source control, collaborative development features
