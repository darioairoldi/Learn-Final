## Executive Summary

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an **open standard that enables AI applications to access external data sources, tools, and resources** through a standardized interface.

Think of it as a "universal adapter" for AI applications - just as a universal adapter connects physical devices to different accessories, MCP connects AI applications to various data sources and tools without requiring custom connections for each one.

## Core Concepts

### What is Model Context Protocol?

MCP addresses a fundamental challenge in AI development: **How do we provide AI models with more context and the ability to perform actions on our behalf?**

The protocol enables AI tools to access:

- **Real-time data**
- **Business-specific information**
- **External APIs** and **services**
- **Custom tools** and **resources**

![alt text](<images/000.01 MCPdefined.png>)

### The Three Components of MCP

#### 1. **Hosts**
- Programs that want access to data and tools through MCP
- Examples: **Visual Studio Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Copilot Studio**
- These are the applications where users interact with AI

#### 2. **Clients**
- Maintain one-to-one connections with MCP servers
- Can sometimes be the same as hosts
- Handle the communication protocol between hosts and servers

#### 3. **Servers**
- **Lightweight programs that expose capabilities through MCP**
- The actual providers of data, tools, and functionality
- Can run locally, in containers, or remotely

- Creating and managing GitHub issues
- Accessing repository information
- All without leaving the development environment

### Custom MCP Servers

The session featured a compelling example called the **"Monkey MCP Server"** that demonstrated how developers can create custom MCP servers tailored to specific business needs or personal interests.

#### The "Monkey MCP Server" Example

**What it is:**
- A custom MCP server created by one of the presenters who "loves monkeys"
- Designed to work with the **"Monkey App Vibes"** .NET MAUI application
- Demonstrates how MCP servers can be domain-specific and highly personalized

**The Live Demonstration:**
During the session, the presenter showed a real-time example of how MCP works by using natural language queries:

1. **"Get me a list of monkeys"** - The AI automatically discovered and used the `get_monkeys` tool
2. **Data visualization** - The raw JSON data was automatically converted into a formatted table  
3. **Schema analysis** - When asked "what is the JSON schema here?", the AI analyzed and displayed the data structure
4. **Format conversion** - The presenter even asked "what would this look like in COBOL?" and the AI converted the data format

**Key Functionality:**
- **`get_monkeys` tool** - Retrieves structured monkey data from the custom server
- **JSON data provider** - Returns monkey information in a standardized format
- **Schema-aware responses** - Provides consistent data structure for AI analysis
- **Seamless integration** - Works alongside other MCP servers like the GitHub server

![alt text](<images/001.01 MCP Commands discovered.png>)

**Technical Implementation:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "monkey-server": {
      "command": "path/to/monkey-mcp-server",
      "args": ["--data-source", "monkey-database"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Real-world Workflow Impact:**
As the presenter emphasized: *"I'm a developer. I no longer have to leave my flow no matter where I'm at. I might just be somewhere not in VS Code, some other editor... But I can say, OK, get me a list of monkeys here."*

This demonstrates the core value proposition of MCP - maintaining workflow continuity while accessing external data and tools through natural language interactions.
