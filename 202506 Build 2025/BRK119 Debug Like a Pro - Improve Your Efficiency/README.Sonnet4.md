> **"The more targeted data you can give to Copilot, the better answers you're going to get from it."** - Charlie Aslan

This fundamental principle drives the entire debugging methodology presented throughout the session. Charlie emphasizes that AI success depends directly on context quality and specificity rather than generic problem descriptions.

> **"I feel like having these analysis features, or even having Copilot in Visual Studio is like a 24/7 expert with me, I can ask any question to it."** - Harshada Hole

Harshada's insight captures the transformative nature of AI-assisted debugging: from isolated problem-solving to continuous expert collaboration that enhances developer capabilities rather than replacing human expertise.

### Iterative Problem-Solving Approach

> **"You will not get a one-shot answer or a fix right away in many cases, but you don't have to give up. This thread you have open here, it contains all the context... you need to keep chatting with the model and working through the problem."** - Charlie Aslan

Charlie's guidance on persistence and iterative improvement becomes central to successful AI-assisted debugging. The session demonstrates that AI collaboration requires patience, guidance, and conversational refinement rather than expecting immediate perfect solutions.

> **"Instead of opening up a new thread and starting from scratch... this is going to be the best chance for success."** - Charlie Aslan

This insight emphasizes the importance of maintaining conversation context and building upon previous AI interactions rather than restarting analysis from scratch, which preserves valuable context and increases solution probability.
