NOTE Confidence: 0.726743757724762

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.840
So my name is Derek and this is Ryan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8912191390991211

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.634
We're going to talk about how AI is transforming the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8912191390991211

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:05.879
way the people are learning.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8838958740234375

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.691
We are infusing it in that learning journey, whether it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8838958740234375

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:13.155
upfront with how you're planning, how you are going through

NOTE Confidence: 0.8838958740234375

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:16.331
the content, how you are getting your hands within the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8838958740234375

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:19.853
products and how it's also assisting when you're building by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8838958740234375

00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:20.720
show of hands.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8797312378883362

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.489
Who has a hard time keeping up with the rate

NOTE Confidence: 0.8797312378883362

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.200
of change that's being introduced right now?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8076815009117126

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.760
I'm seeing waving of hands energetically, which is awesome.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9731753468513489

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.560
I agree, I have a hard time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8574177026748657

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.269
There's so many amazing things have been announced just this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8574177026748657

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.640
week.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9216710925102234

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.017
It's going to take me forever to catch up on

NOTE Confidence: 0.9216710925102234

00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:40.720
all of that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9350736737251282

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.287
And so the introduction of AI into a lot of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9350736737251282

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:47.686
the tools will really help you to be able to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9350736737251282

00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:51.236
catch up faster, to be able to get to building

NOTE Confidence: 0.9350736737251282

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:53.199
faster and keep building.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8487393260002136

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.549
One of the fastest growing skills is right now is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8487393260002136

00:00:57.617 --> 00:00:58.360
AI fluency.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8757622241973877

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.520
And that's not just technical roles, that's also non-technical roles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8885199427604675

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.920
About 73% of U.S.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9514559507369995

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.800
companies say that AI is it's really powering their growth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.836823582649231

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.480
They're using it for for their growth activities.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9545689225196838

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.702
The other 27%, what's happening with them, and a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.9545689225196838

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.239
of it comes down to they're not ready.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9102723598480225

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.080
The organization, the individuals are not ready for that change.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254072308540344

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.722
So we historically with Microsoft Learn have provided documentation, Q&A,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254072308540344

00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:30.649
training shows, a whole bunch of resources to help people

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254072308540344

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:34.130
as they're going through the building journey, the learning journey,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9254072308540344

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.240
the building journey.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9436732530593872

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.299
They're very interconnected, but that takes a lot of upfront

NOTE Confidence: 0.9436732530593872

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.014
work that takes you out of that flow of work

NOTE Confidence: 0.9436732530593872

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:45.996
commonly, and you're searching for the resources even when you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.9436732530593872

00:01:46.057 --> 00:01:46.599
building.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8994166851043701

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.855
So what developers have been asking for is they want

NOTE Confidence: 0.8994166851043701

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:51.959
troubleshooting to be more streamlined.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9241321682929993

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.360
They want to stay in the flow of work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9143547415733337

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.974
They don't want to have to bounce out and bounce

NOTE Confidence: 0.9143547415733337

00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:58.988
across a bunch of different websites looking for that doc

NOTE Confidence: 0.9143547415733337

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.600
that answer to their question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039885401725769

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.308
They want those experiences to be personalized for them where

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039885401725769

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.075
it takes into account what they already know, it takes

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039885401725769

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.742
into account what they don't know or what what we're

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039885401725769

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:10.999
unaware of them knowing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9439481496810913

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.800
So now it's tailored to them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8900634050369263

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.983
They also want the context brought in, the context from

NOTE Confidence: 0.8900634050369263

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.559
their organization, the subscriptions that they have.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9232895374298096

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.040
What do they already have built?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9407676458358765

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.760
These are really hard things to solve for.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8567321300506592

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.689
But they also want less time in the docks, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.8567321300506592

00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:29.280
killed me because I'm responsible for Microsoft learning product experiences.

NOTE Confidence: 0.949004054069519

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.920
So that's hard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9239147305488586

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.765
However, if we can take a lot of that knowledge,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9239147305488586

00:02:34.817 --> 00:02:37.763
that underlying knowledge base and bring it to where the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9239147305488586

00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:40.498
developers are and meet them where they are, and so

NOTE Confidence: 0.9239147305488586

00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:43.813
then they can actually get to the successfully deploying their

NOTE Confidence: 0.9239147305488586

00:02:43.865 --> 00:02:44.760
solutions faster.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8943493366241455

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
That's an amazing win.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7854187488555908

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.487
And so last October 2023, we had Azure Copilot launched

NOTE Confidence: 0.7854187488555908

00:02:50.554 --> 00:02:54.845
an underlying answering the plurality of those questions was the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7854187488555908

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:59.070
Microsoft Learn knowledge base where we're pulling in our doc,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7854187488555908

00:02:59.137 --> 00:03:03.160
our knowledge from our documentation, our training, our Q&A.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8130068778991699

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.980
Back in November of last year, we introduced Ask Learn

NOTE Confidence: 0.8130068778991699

00:03:08.044 --> 00:03:10.159
chat on Microsoft Learn training.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9391291737556458

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.273
So now as you're going through that training experience, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9391291737556458

00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:14.960
have a question on what was that term?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9133557677268982

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.465
What was that thing that I forgot and, and it

NOTE Confidence: 0.9133557677268982

00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:18.679
interrupted my training.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8514099717140198

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.160
We've now extended that to all Azure documentation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7951486706733704

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.133
Pretty soon, shortly after build, we're going to extend it

NOTE Confidence: 0.7951486706733704

00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:26.359
to all documentation on Learn.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557555079460144

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.922
The coolest part for me about that is that you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557555079460144

00:03:30.998 --> 00:03:34.645
looking at a doc and it can answer your question

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557555079460144

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.976
kind of, but but your problem, your question is probably

NOTE Confidence: 0.8557555079460144

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:40.800
more complex than that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8123339414596558

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.249
And so you so you'll want to be able to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8123339414596558

00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:46.290
ask that complex question instead of bouncing across a few

NOTE Confidence: 0.8123339414596558

00:03:46.342 --> 00:03:46.599
docs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8754743337631226

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.305
Askler and chat is now right there on the documentation

NOTE Confidence: 0.8754743337631226

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:53.407
to be able to handle the more complex problems and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8754743337631226

00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:54.320
opportunities.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8423058986663818

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.134
Also, what's not on this slide is we are introducing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8423058986663818

00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:02.777
a private preview for Askler and Tutor, which is AVS

NOTE Confidence: 0.8423058986663818

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:04.839
code extension where you are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062793850898743

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.843
We are using a Socratic reasoning method where you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062793850898743

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.235
you can say I want to learn this thing and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062793850898743

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.350
it will help to build out the learning objectives based

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062793850898743

00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:15.519
on that, it will build the curriculum.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9067885279655457

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.599
So now you can get hands on with with your

NOTE Confidence: 0.9067885279655457

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:18.639
learning experience.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8438000082969666

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.878
And with that, I'm going to stop talking and hand

NOTE Confidence: 0.8438000082969666

00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:23.529
over to Ryan to do the more fun part, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.8438000082969666

00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:24.279
is a live demo all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.611627459526062

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.720
Right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.775027871131897

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.720
Thanks, Derek, everyone.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899980366230011

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.304
So we are excited to, to share Ask Learn, as

NOTE Confidence: 0.899980366230011

00:04:32.386 --> 00:04:38.088
Derek mentioned, developers and organizations, you know, there's a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.899980366230011

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.162
to keep up with and helping them select the right

NOTE Confidence: 0.899980366230011

00:04:42.243 --> 00:04:46.479
technology to learn about all the details behind it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8944394588470459

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.411
And then also of course, troubleshooting is where I think

NOTE Confidence: 0.8944394588470459

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:50.800
Ask Learn can really help.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8970856666564941

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.926
So what we have here is an Azure Docs in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8970856666564941

00:04:54.003 --> 00:04:57.784
the Azure App Service and we're going to go ahead

NOTE Confidence: 0.8970856666564941

00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:01.333
and find Ask, Learn here and we can invoke it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8970856666564941

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.879
and be able to interact with it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799071311950684

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.626
Easy prompt would be help me summarize this page, make

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799071311950684

00:05:07.686 --> 00:05:09.239
it more contextual for me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8639939427375793

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.480
I'm going to go ahead and query that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7704170346260071

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.563
And then it's able to break down the full docs

NOTE Confidence: 0.7704170346260071

00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:21.941
article for you in in kind of a layout and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7704170346260071

00:05:22.043 --> 00:05:22.960
overview.

NOTE Confidence: 0.943061113357544

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.431
But in addition to that, you know, there's a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.943061113357544

00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:30.255
of gaps in coverage for documentation just in general, not

NOTE Confidence: 0.943061113357544

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.199
necessarily for our articles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.857195258140564

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.133
But if I'm exploring different technologies and I wanted to

NOTE Confidence: 0.857195258140564

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.533
understand what's the difference between an Azure App Service and

NOTE Confidence: 0.857195258140564

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.933
say, ask or Azure Functions for me and what should

NOTE Confidence: 0.857195258140564

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.599
I choose?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8998233675956726

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.829
This helps cross information going from the one documentation to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8998233675956726

00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:53.571
the next to be very targeted to the examples that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8998233675956726

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:54.319
you need.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8595280647277832

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.139
So you'll be able to engage with ask learning in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8595280647277832

00:05:58.201 --> 00:05:59.119
all those ways.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8094247579574585

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.270
Some of the smaller things just to and and the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8094247579574585

00:06:02.318 --> 00:06:03.240
details about this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8916522860527039

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.080
It does have a short term memory.

NOTE Confidence: 0.889984130859375

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.658
So you can go from one docs to the next,

NOTE Confidence: 0.889984130859375

00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:10.474
get a better sense of, you know, the the context

NOTE Confidence: 0.889984130859375

00:06:10.531 --> 00:06:13.519
of the project and everything that's going on there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9106802940368652

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.440
This is just we're just getting started.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8506459593772888

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.007
As Derek mentioned, we're on Azure Docs right now and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8506459593772888

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:21.239
all of training on Microsoft Learn.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9034767746925354

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.560
Pretty soon you'll start to see it across all documentation,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9034767746925354

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:28.434
which would enable about 80% of all of our pages

NOTE Confidence: 0.9034767746925354

00:06:28.493 --> 00:06:31.368
that we have on Learn, which is many thousands of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9034767746925354

00:06:31.426 --> 00:06:31.720
them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9303533434867859

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.026
And from there, I will move us over to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9303533434867859

00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:41.119
tutor, which is ask Learn Assistant now on VS Code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9618147611618042

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.922
And we're really excited about this because it really keeps

NOTE Confidence: 0.9618147611618042

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.944
the developer in the flow of work to be able

NOTE Confidence: 0.9618147611618042

00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:53.511
to help troubleshoot or even just understand specific concepts that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9618147611618042

00:06:53.578 --> 00:06:54.720
might be helpful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609951734542847

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.133
And so accessing Microsoft Learn training directly in VS Code

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609951734542847

00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.279
is something that we're really excited about.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8330243825912476

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.280
And to get more feedback about what would be next,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8330243825912476

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.040
how we how to, how we develop this extension.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9584851861000061

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.145
So right here I have a query about help me

NOTE Confidence: 0.9584851861000061

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.759
choose the right model with AI Foundry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7832542657852173

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.651
I'm going to query that and it's first going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7832542657852173

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:22.520
with the Socratic, Socratic questioning that Derek mentioned.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9378776550292969

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.104
It's going to get a better need to get a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9378776550292969

00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:27.935
better sense of what we're going after to be able

NOTE Confidence: 0.9378776550292969

00:07:27.992 --> 00:07:30.823
to help you choose the right model and also breaks

NOTE Confidence: 0.9378776550292969

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:34.333
down the principles and concepts behind that, points out some

NOTE Confidence: 0.9378776550292969

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.844
of the prerequisites of of understanding before we dive right

NOTE Confidence: 0.9378776550292969

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.919
into that problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9121690988540649

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.917
So I'm just going to simply say, you know, I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9121690988540649

00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:43.280
know these prereqs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.832191526889801

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.968
And it's proceeding now into more of the com complicated

NOTE Confidence: 0.832191526889801

00:08:03.056 --> 00:08:04.640
problems for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9548459649085999

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.480
So I'll just say, you know, this is great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9723825454711914

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:12.738
Let's proceed and you can see how that interaction can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9723825454711914

00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:18.070
continue to guide you towards the right path.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9149832129478455

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.820
Lastly, I'd like to also share something that seems to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9149832129478455

00:08:23.887 --> 00:08:27.584
be a crowd pleaser for us, which is planned development

NOTE Confidence: 0.9149832129478455

00:08:27.652 --> 00:08:28.190
with AI.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9072085022926331

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.477
So being able to just remove the guesswork of what

NOTE Confidence: 0.9072085022926331

00:08:31.543 --> 00:08:34.173
it's going to take for me to learn up on

NOTE Confidence: 0.9072085022926331

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:38.250
this next technology is something that we're really seeing is

NOTE Confidence: 0.9072085022926331

00:08:38.316 --> 00:08:39.960
helpful for for everyone.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8258472084999084

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.326
So from here, I'm actually on the Microsoft Learn training

NOTE Confidence: 0.8258472084999084

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:43.920
home page.

NOTE Confidence: 0.937126636505127

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.298
I'm going to go ahead and click on to create

NOTE Confidence: 0.937126636505127

00:08:46.346 --> 00:08:46.680
a plan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9355912208557129

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.040
There's four different tracks for me to understand.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8475133776664734

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.666
Is this going to help me grow my career in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8475133776664734

00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:54.797
the the right track there versus a specific project that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8475133776664734

00:08:54.852 --> 00:08:56.280
I want to understand more?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8498327732086182

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.622
So back to the example of understanding an Azure App

NOTE Confidence: 0.8498327732086182

00:08:59.687 --> 00:09:01.679
Service in the right direction.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9079293012619019

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:06.034
I went ahead and went through these steps already created

NOTE Confidence: 0.9079293012619019

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.166
a plan, and what you can see here is how

NOTE Confidence: 0.9079293012619019

00:09:09.242 --> 00:09:12.680
to migrate applications to Azure App Service.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8765922784805298

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:16.613
It has the learning outcomes specifically called out for the,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8765922784805298

00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:19.837
the type of learning that you'll be doing and you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8765922784805298

00:09:19.902 --> 00:09:23.513
can go through all the learning paths that are available

NOTE Confidence: 0.8765922784805298

00:09:23.578 --> 00:09:26.479
based off of exactly what you've been putted.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8769696950912476

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.411
It in addition to that, say you're a manager and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8769696950912476

00:09:29.472 --> 00:09:32.098
you want to be able to help your team learn

NOTE Confidence: 0.8769696950912476

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:34.479
the, the best way of going about this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9268707633018494

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.800
So you can simply share.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9243752956390381

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.683
And when you copy the link, it'll create a reporting

NOTE Confidence: 0.9243752956390381

00:09:38.735 --> 00:09:41.161
link directly for you so you can help track and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9243752956390381

00:09:41.212 --> 00:09:44.619
understand progress, make sure everybody's scaling up in the right

NOTE Confidence: 0.9243752956390381

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.199
direction for the project that you have in place.

NOTE Confidence: 0.95463627576828

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:57.235
And so that's kind of concludes most of what we

NOTE Confidence: 0.95463627576828

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.340
wanted to share.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9142526388168335

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.096
We have a ton more for you back at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8941948413848877

00:10:07.968 --> 00:10:11.347
but wanted to share specifically, you know, three days at

out, give us feedback as we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.880371630191803

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.260
That's really what this era of using AI, building new

NOTE Confidence: 0.880371630191803

00:10:20.323 --> 00:10:24.925
technologies, just getting it out there, bringing that feedback, continue

NOTE Confidence: 0.880371630191803

00:10:24.988 --> 00:10:27.762
to iterate and build of of how to be helpful
