## Introduction: The Challenge of Keeping Up

### Current State of Developer Learning

**00:00:00** - **00:01:00** (1m 0s)  
**Speakers:** Derek Peterson

**Derek Peterson** opens the session by addressing a fundamental challenge facing developers today: the overwhelming pace of technological change.<br>
Through an interactive show of hands, he demonstrates that most attendees struggle to keep up with the rapid rate of innovation being introduced, particularly the numerous announcements made during Build 2025 week alone.

The introduction of AI into development tools is positioned as a solution to help developers catch up faster and maintain their building momentum.<br>
Peterson emphasizes that AI fluency has become one of the fastest-growing skills, affecting not just technical roles but non-technical positions as well.

### AI Fluency as a Growing Skill

**00:01:00** - **00:01:30** (30s)  
**Speakers:** Derek Peterson

Peterson presents compelling statistics showing that approximately **73% of U.S. companies** report that AI is powering their growth activities.<br>
The **remaining 27%** face challenges primarily due to organizational and individual readiness for AI adoption. <br>
This data underscores the critical importance of AI education and training in today's business landscape.

## Microsoft Learn Evolution

### Historical Learning Resources

**00:01:30** - **00:02:00** (30s)  
**Speakers:** Derek Peterson

**Microsoft Learn** has traditionally provided comprehensive learning resources including <mark>documentation</mark>, <mark>Q&A platforms</mark>, training modules, and educational shows.<br> However, these resources often require significant upfront work that interrupts the developer's workflow, forcing them to search across multiple websites for answers to their questions.

### Developer Pain Points

**00:02:00** - **00:02:45** (45s)  
**Speakers:** Derek Peterson

Peterson outlines key developer frustrations with traditional learning approaches:

- **Streamlined Troubleshooting**: Developers want more efficient problem-solving processes
- **Flow State Preservation**: The need to stay in their development workflow without bouncing between multiple resources
- **Personalization**: Experiences tailored to individual knowledge levels and learning gaps
- **Contextual Integration**: Learning that incorporates organizational context, existing subscriptions, and previously built solutions
- **Reduced Documentation Time**: Paradoxically, developers want less time in documentation while still accessing comprehensive knowledge

## Ask Learn Chat: Documentation Assistant

### Azure Copilot Foundation

**00:02:45** - **00:03:30** (45s)  
**Speakers:** Derek Peterson

The Ask Learn initiative builds upon the foundation established by Azure Copilot, launched in October 2023.<br>
The underlying system leverages Microsoft Learn's extensive knowledge base, incorporating documentation, training materials, and Q&A content to provide comprehensive answers to developer questions.

### Extended Coverage and Capabilities

**00:03:30** - **00:04:30** (1m 0s)  
**Speakers:** Derek Peterson

The evolution of Ask Learn shows progressive expansion:

- **November 2024**: Introduction of Ask Learn chat on Microsoft Learn training platforms
- **Current State**: Extension to all Azure documentation
- **Near Future**: Planned extension to all Microsoft Learn documentation post-Build 2025

The system's strength lies in handling complex, multi-faceted questions that would traditionally require consulting multiple documentation sources. Instead of bouncing between different docs, users can ask sophisticated questions and receive comprehensive, contextualized answers.

## Ask Learn Tutor: VS Code Extension

### Socratic Reasoning Method

**00:04:30** - **00:04:50** (20s)  
**Speakers:** Derek Peterson

Peterson introduces the Ask Learn Tutor as a private preview VS Code extension that employs Socratic reasoning methodology. This approach allows learners to express their learning goals, and the system responds by building appropriate learning objectives and curriculum structure automatically.

### Hands-on Learning Experience

**00:04:50** - **00:05:00** (10s)  
**Speakers:** Derek Peterson

The VS Code extension enables immediate hands-on engagement with learning content, eliminating the traditional gap between theoretical learning and practical application.

## Live Demonstrations

### Ask Learn Chat Demo

**00:05:00** - **00:06:00** (1m 0s)  
**Speakers:** Ryan Currie

Ryan Currie demonstrates the Ask Learn chat functionality using Azure App Service documentation as an example. The demo showcases:

- **Page Summarization**: The ability to break down complex documentation into digestible overviews
- **Cross-Technology Comparison**: Intelligent comparison between Azure services (App Service vs. Azure Functions vs. AKS) with personalized recommendations
- **Contextual Understanding**: The system's capability to provide targeted information based on specific use cases

### VS Code Extension Demo

**00:06:00** - **00:08:20** (2m 20s)  
**Speakers:** Ryan Currie

The VS Code extension demonstration focuses on AI Foundry model selection, illustrating:

- **Socratic Questioning**: The system asks clarifying questions to understand user needs and knowledge level
- **Prerequisite Assessment**: Intelligent evaluation of user's existing knowledge before diving into complex topics
- **Interactive Learning Path**: Guided progression through increasingly sophisticated concepts
- **Contextual Memory**: The extension maintains conversation context across different documentation pages

### AI-Powered Learning Plans

**00:08:20** - **00:09:50** (1m 30s)  
**Speakers:** Ryan Currie

Currie demonstrates the AI-powered learning plan creation feature, which offers four distinct tracks:

- **Career Growth**: Professional development-focused learning paths
- **Project-Specific**: Targeted learning for specific technical implementations
- **Personalized Outcomes**: Learning objectives tailored to individual goals
- **Team Management**: Sharing and tracking capabilities for managers overseeing team development

The demo shows how learning plans include specific outcomes, relevant learning paths, and progress tracking mechanisms for both individuals and teams.

## Future Vision and Rollout

### Expansion Plans

**00:09:50** - **00:10:30** (40s)  
**Speakers:** Ryan Currie

The roadmap includes extending Ask Learn chat to approximately 80% of all Microsoft Learn pages, encompassing thousands of documentation articles. This expansion will significantly broaden the coverage and utility of AI-assisted learning across Microsoft's technology stack.

### Feedback and Iteration

**00:10:30** - **00:10:55** (25s)  
**Speakers:** Ryan Currie

Currie emphasizes the importance of user feedback in the current era of AI tool development. The team encourages active trial usage and continuous feedback to iterate and improve the AI learning assistance capabilities. The session concludes with information about joining the VS Code extension waiting list for early access.
