Presentation Goal 

.NET is transforming how developers build AI native applications and agents. With deep integrations throughout the AI ecosystem, a streamlined development process with Microsoft.Extension.AI, templates to jumpstart development, and the ability to leverage and build the latest in Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agents, .NET is the go to for AI development. Come see how all of this works together and how we are evolving .NET for developers to build interactive agents that communicate silently and at lightning speed. Tell the front-end agent to book travel to the Build conference, and your calendar invites and expense report confirmations start appearing. Agents are transforming business processes and this session explores how .NET and AI can optimize workflows and integrate agents into applications. Learn to use familiar tools to build and manage intelligent agents, enhancing productivity and communication within organizations.
