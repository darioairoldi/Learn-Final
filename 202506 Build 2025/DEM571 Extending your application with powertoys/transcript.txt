00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.120
Oh, thank you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6123513579368591

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.760
Thank you everybody.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7496378421783447

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.480
Oh, welcome everybody.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8315185308456421

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.680
I hope you've been having a great build this far.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7602425813674927

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.200
My name is Nils Lauda and I'm joined today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8781399726867676

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.240
By I'm Mike.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4477882385253906

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.120
Here's Mike.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8462782502174377

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.120
And we work in the Windows Developer Platform team.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718284964561462

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.512
So that means our team is responsible for things like

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718284964561462

00:00:17.572 --> 00:00:20.606
Windows Terminal and WCL and Power Toys and all the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718284964561462

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:21.319
good stuff.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8482208847999573

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.559
And today we're actually going to talk about Windows Command

NOTE Confidence: 0.8482208847999573

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:24.759
Pal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8304855823516846

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.722
So Windows Command Pal is something that we shipped last

NOTE Confidence: 0.8304855823516846

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.359
month as part of Power Toys.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9437786936759949

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.455
And if you're familiar with Power Toys Run, this is

NOTE Confidence: 0.9437786936759949

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.960
really the next generation of it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7538427710533142

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.000
So we build it from scratch with Win UI.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9073663949966431

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.165
It's blazing fast and it really helps you to find

NOTE Confidence: 0.9073663949966431

00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:42.627
files or launch apps and do a lot of other

NOTE Confidence: 0.9073663949966431

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:46.520
things because we actually have a great accessibility model, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9579934477806091

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.360
That's right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9232369065284729

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.118
So maybe instead of just talking about it, we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9232369065284729

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:51.879
actually show what it can do, yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9102585911750793

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.848
Let's do that so you know this is the Windows

NOTE Confidence: 0.9102585911750793

00:00:55.926 --> 00:01:00.160
Command palette which is not showing up on the screen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6954740285873413

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.600
Exit the PowerPoint.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8422727584838867

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.200
Oh yeah, that's probably it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8640301823616028

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.880
That's it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9358442425727844

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.880
That's what it is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9769059419631958

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.600
There we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7140747308731079

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.560
There we, This is the Windows Command Palette.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8136913180351257

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.418
As you can see, you know, it's pretty much your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8136913180351257

00:01:13.464 --> 00:01:14.159
basic launcher.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8785531520843506

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.380
You know, you can find the apps you're looking for,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8785531520843506

00:01:16.423 --> 00:01:18.600
whatever, you can do calculations, look for files.

NOTE Confidence: 0.861836850643158

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.266
But the real power of the Command palette comes from

NOTE Confidence: 0.861836850643158

00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:22.440
its extensibility, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.867940366268158

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.406
Any app can plug into the Windows Command Palette and

NOTE Confidence: 0.867940366268158

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:28.244
add their own commands and their own little snippets of

NOTE Confidence: 0.867940366268158

00:01:28.294 --> 00:01:31.082
functionality straight to it that give all the power of

NOTE Confidence: 0.867940366268158

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.159
your app right at the user's fingertips.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9164383411407471

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.557
So like as an example, here is this GitHub extension

NOTE Confidence: 0.9164383411407471

00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:39.039
that we have right and I can pull up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8694004416465759

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.282
This is a list of all of my issues for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8694004416465759

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:43.199
the Command Palette on Power Toys.

NOTE Confidence: 0.935640275478363

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.158
But I can just like very quickly search through this

NOTE Confidence: 0.935640275478363

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.543
and like look for, you know, an issue that I'm

NOTE Confidence: 0.935640275478363

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:50.725
looking for and I can pull up all sorts of

NOTE Confidence: 0.935640275478363

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.399
commands that are related to it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8631337285041809

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.668
You know, if I just want to like quickly copy

NOTE Confidence: 0.8631337285041809

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.280
the link to something, I can do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8516515493392944

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.587
Or, you know, if I wanted to browse the actual

NOTE Confidence: 0.8516515493392944

00:01:58.632 --> 00:02:01.195
issues on GitHub straight from the Command palette, I can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8516515493392944

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.599
do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7511975765228271

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.160
And I couldn't quickly triage stuff.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8998523354530334

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.972
And that's because you know there's this extension for GitHub

NOTE Confidence: 0.8998523354530334

00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:10.160
right here in the command palette.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8230922818183899

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.852
So you have a lot of things to do still,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8230922818183899

00:02:11.894 --> 00:02:12.360
it seems I.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6531879901885986

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.960
Have a lot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5377231240272522

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.960
Of open issues.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8026444911956787

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.000
So it's a lot of stuff.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8821554780006409

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.240
Whatever, it's fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8633149266242981

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.520
We're working on it, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8405715227127075

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.160
So how can we basically build our own extension?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672018647193909

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.480
How does that?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9707182049751282

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.760
Work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7740989327430725

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:25.054
I think it'd be cool if we just built one

NOTE Confidence: 0.7740989327430725

00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:27.960
right here on stage live, and we can.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9479992389678955

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.400
We have 12 minutes left.

NOTE Confidence: 0.824758768081665

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.280
We can do it in 12.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5947394967079163

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.520
Minutes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6283382177352905

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.240
OK, that's cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7773405313491821

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.650
So what we're going to do is we're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7773405313491821

00:02:33.694 --> 00:02:36.200
create an extension right from the command Pallet itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8616107702255249

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.140
So if we just run this create new extension commands,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8616107702255249

00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:42.183
you can see command pallet comes with everything you need

NOTE Confidence: 0.8616107702255249

00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:44.440
to get started building extensions for it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7767838835716248

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.120
So I'm just going to call this build demo my.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8244921565055847

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.366
Build so I don't need to clone a repo or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8244921565055847

00:02:52.442 --> 00:02:53.719
do anything else.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8033875823020935

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.991
You can just create your own solution right from command

NOTE Confidence: 0.8033875823020935

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:56.600
pallet itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7114438414573669

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.363
So getting started is, as Mike is showing, really, really

NOTE Confidence: 0.7114438414573669

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.759
easy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5409024953842163

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.520
So that's easy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722667098045349

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.884
All right, so we can open this solution up and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722667098045349

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:08.359
I'm just going to start building this in the background.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8709830045700073

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.984
But let's let's take a quick tour through what we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8709830045700073

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.600
made here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9652553796768188

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.681
This is kind of the template project that's made when

NOTE Confidence: 0.9652553796768188

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.599
you first create your extension.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9436185359954834

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.272
And if you come in here, you know, we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.9436185359954834

00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:21.400
our command provider.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693109154701233

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.247
This is the part where command pilot kind of calls

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693109154701233

00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:27.138
into your extension and asks for a list of commands,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693109154701233

00:03:27.192 --> 00:03:27.520
right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9206168055534363

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.313
Right now we just have we have one command this

NOTE Confidence: 0.9206168055534363

00:03:30.368 --> 00:03:30.920
demo page.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8697168231010437

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.018
So this is the command that shows up on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8697168231010437

00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:33.839
on the 1st on the.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8671919107437134

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.472
Top level right, that's right and then we come in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8671919107437134

00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:37.439
oh, not that one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8923431038856506

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.047
We come into our pages and we have our builds

NOTE Confidence: 0.8923431038856506

00:03:40.105 --> 00:03:42.829
demo page which is loading and here this is you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8923431038856506

00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:45.959
know, the actual commands that the user will see when

NOTE Confidence: 0.8923431038856506

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.640
they open up our extensions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9195809960365295

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.331
So if I come in here and I open up

NOTE Confidence: 0.9195809960365295

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.977
the command palette, I can go here to our extension

NOTE Confidence: 0.9195809960365295

00:03:57.085 --> 00:03:59.039
and once it loads.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8878746628761292

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.280
So that's the flow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7773878574371338

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.076
So you basically deploy it and you're just reloading command

NOTE Confidence: 0.7773878574371338

00:04:03.122 --> 00:04:05.080
pilot and that's the way how you can look.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8680557608604431

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.600
There you go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7179306745529175

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880
It's the extension, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8140758872032166

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.240
That's cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.852514386177063

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.800
You do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8398305177688599

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.200
That took us one minute.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8513600826263428

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.240
Yeah, but thank you all for attending.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4932577908039093

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.840
No, no joke.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8450319766998291

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.960
So what else can we do?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9659615159034729

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.600
We should make our extension do something.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5689433217048645

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.640
Yeah, right of our point.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9302788376808167

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.120
Let's just start with something simple.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8269879221916199

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.724
Let's just like add a link to the Power Toys

NOTE Confidence: 0.8269879221916199

00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:25.079
repo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.33027827739715576

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.360
Yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7104974389076233

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.700
All right, so I'm just going to try and drop

NOTE Confidence: 0.7104974389076233

00:04:27.746 --> 00:04:29.760
this because no one wants to watch me type.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9304981231689453

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.381
And So what we're doing here is we're just adding

NOTE Confidence: 0.9304981231689453

00:04:33.432 --> 00:04:35.525
a new list item, and that list item has a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9304981231689453

00:04:35.576 --> 00:04:37.719
command, and the command is open this URL.

NOTE Confidence: 0.956322431564331

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.080
We're just giving it a little title.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8365421295166016

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.280
Just going to build that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8432159423828125

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.200
So this will be the default command as well right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8803889155387878

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.117
So if I type in and just hit enter, it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8803889155387878

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.480
will just launch this URL.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7327775955200195

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.800
Yes, yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213816523551941

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.197
So we're just going to open this up and we're

NOTE Confidence: 0.9213816523551941

00:04:49.228 --> 00:04:50.719
going to come back and we're going to reload it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8600655198097229

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.432
We're going to come back and it's going to boot

NOTE Confidence: 0.8600655198097229

00:04:54.468 --> 00:04:54.760
into it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6200498938560486

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.640
Come here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6703381538391113

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.080
Look, there's power toys that works.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9388740658760071

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.400
Look, it does something now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899665117263794

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.000
Nice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7345771789550781

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.948
That was another 30 seconds, so that's good, but it

NOTE Confidence: 0.7345771789550781

00:05:04.982 --> 00:05:05.120
can.

NOTE Confidence: 0.956375002861023

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.160
Probably do more than that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6158872246742249

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.880
Right, right, right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8648523092269897

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.182
Like usually you want to have your apps do more

NOTE Confidence: 0.8648523092269897

00:05:11.228 --> 00:05:13.280
than one thing, so let's add another command.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9112375974655151

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.000
Let's come back here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7087731957435608

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.680
Let's add a command.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7691439390182495

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.481
I don't know, let's have it open up command prompt,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7691439390182495

00:05:20.536 --> 00:05:21.240
right, Right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8536980748176575

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.440
Something pretty simple.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8548843264579773

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.075
But you know, you can do more than just opening

NOTE Confidence: 0.8548843264579773

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:27.000
up URLs, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8681545257568359

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.425
This is kind of showing off that I have code

NOTE Confidence: 0.8681545257568359

00:05:29.481 --> 00:05:33.064
here for launching arbitrary processes, you know, or just running

NOTE Confidence: 0.8681545257568359

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:35.159
whatever code you want from your app.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9659162163734436

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.480
You can do this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7889440655708313

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.315
And it already comes up with a bunch of like

NOTE Confidence: 0.7889440655708313

00:05:38.357 --> 00:05:39.400
built in commands, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9314486980438232

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.880
So I don't need to worry about handling processes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7853053212165833

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.280
That anonymous command, we'll just do that for, yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8771420121192932

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.039
We have a tool kit with all sorts of helpers

NOTE Confidence: 0.8771420121192932

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:47.719
in it just to make your life a lot easier.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8925475478172302

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.407
Like for instance, we have these icon info helpers for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8925475478172302

00:05:51.475 --> 00:05:54.479
finding new icons for your extension, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039256572723389

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.462
Just to give it like this isn't very helpful to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9039256572723389

00:05:57.525 --> 00:05:58.160
me, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8606498837471008

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.720
Be cool if that was like the icon for GitHub.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9392463564872742

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.480
So if I reload this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8694312572479248

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.568
So you can pull icons from the actual axe right

NOTE Confidence: 0.8694312572479248

00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:09.355
of the applications or from the web, or you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8694312572479248

00:06:09.413 --> 00:06:10.400
list your own or.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9015810489654541

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.600
Yeah, that's right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8607206344604492

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.488
So here we have, you know, power toys or open

NOTE Confidence: 0.8607206344604492

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:14.159
command prompt.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6953094005584717

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.520
Oh, that great cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.948432445526123

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.160
That was another 30 seconds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.545682966709137

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.200
Oh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7863797545433044

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.840
There we go, 8 minutes left.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7940872311592102

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.680
So what else?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8449819087982178

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.000
OK, 8 minutes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8940465450286865

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.280
I don't know, maybe.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8086251020431519

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.078
Like I saw the we can probably do something with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8086251020431519

00:06:30.127 --> 00:06:31.159
the side pane, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484313488006592

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.974
I saw some of your of the plug in that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8484313488006592

00:06:33.022 --> 00:06:34.360
you showed right this panel.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7999830842018127

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.040
So there's a bunch of stuff showing here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8954034447669983

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.857
I see it's the same list, but how can we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8954034447669983

00:06:38.907 --> 00:06:40.320
enable this this side panel?

NOTE Confidence: 0.901025652885437

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.120
That's a good idea.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7853362560272217

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.520
You can add details to the items too, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8717631101608276

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.864
If you want to add more context, you know, just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8717631101608276

00:06:46.914 --> 00:06:48.759
like give the users more information.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9205232262611389

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.135
I just happen to have this this right here, which

NOTE Confidence: 0.9205232262611389

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:56.199
is the entire contents of the power toys.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7368899583816528

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.640
Read me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.38067883253097534

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.200
Oh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6679399609565735

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.160
Wow, that's just, you know, markdown.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801767826080322

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.700
So I'm just going to drop that in there and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801767826080322

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.240
I'm going to I put that in the wrong place

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801767826080322

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.839
needs to go here and then I'm going to make

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801767826080322

00:07:06.898 --> 00:07:08.079
this details object.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8754244446754456

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.920
Now let's put that up here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7204753160476685

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.920
OK, so this is a details.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9389685392379761

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.680
It's got details in it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737235069274902

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.360
The details are the contents of this read me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7606581449508667

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.400
It's just marked down.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9600672721862793

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.920
You don't need to worry about how to render it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9575872421264648

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.101
And then I'm just going to stick that over here

NOTE Confidence: 0.9575872421264648

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:27.000
on this list item.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9462240934371948

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.248
I'm going to say the details are my new GitHub

NOTE Confidence: 0.9462240934371948

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:32.040
details.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8471238613128662

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.865
Great, I got to go say that I want details

NOTE Confidence: 0.8471238613128662

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:37.599
visible.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8564885258674622

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.458
OK so with this we basically let the command know

NOTE Confidence: 0.8564885258674622

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:44.394
like oh you need to render this in a different

NOTE Confidence: 0.8564885258674622

00:07:44.435 --> 00:07:44.599
way.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9137773513793945

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.803
Yeah, By the way, I might have details that you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9137773513793945

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:48.000
want to show to the user.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8163038492202759

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.200
So we'll come back over here, load it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7488583326339722

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:53.720
Reload.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8368366360664368

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.000
Oh, look at that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8286184072494507

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.360
Oh nice, it even picks up the images and all

NOTE Confidence: 0.8286184072494507

00:07:57.408 --> 00:07:59.240
that and this is all just marked down.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6534900665283203

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.520
Yeah, this is marked down, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7368051409721375

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.325
Nice, so I saw some of the other extensions have

NOTE Confidence: 0.7368051409721375

00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:05.399
a bunch of like sub commands right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8196084499359131

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.850
I can hit enter to just launch something, but then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8196084499359131

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.400
there's also a bunch of sub commands that we could.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8056394457817078

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.720
That's right, Yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8743930459022522

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.960
So let's let's actually add another top level command, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9544795751571655

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.160
Like let's go in here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9682852029800415

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.251
Right now we just have this one thing that the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9682852029800415

00:08:18.292 --> 00:08:19.279
users can do at the top.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099684715270996

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.559
Then I'll like let's add another thing that the users

NOTE Confidence: 0.8099684715270996

00:08:22.614 --> 00:08:23.000
can do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9517614841461182

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.360
We don't have too many things in there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8409876823425293

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.680
You know, we don't want to overwhelm the users.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9098514914512634

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.440
But let's say I wanted to add, let's say I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9098514914512634

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:36.520
wanted to open up this repo, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9115850925445557

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.880
Just add a shortcut to it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9507451057434082

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880
I can add.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7835698127746582

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.200
Where is this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5882100462913513

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:41.240
All right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9170853495597839

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.720
I need to put that here, don't I?

NOTE Confidence: 0.583930492401123

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.560
Oh, no.

NOTE Confidence: 0.536586582660675

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.240
Oh, there we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5204276442527771

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:46.760
Oh no.

NOTE Confidence: 0.487057089805603

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:47.960
Yep.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8284225463867188

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.360
All right, so this is a oops.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5797526836395264

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.480
Oh yeah, sure, sure.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6641367077827454

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:55.960
Whatever.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9181410670280457

00:08:56.559 --> 00:09:00.596
This isn't just another command for opening up a file

NOTE Confidence: 0.9181410670280457

00:09:00.672 --> 00:09:02.119
right in the shell.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8814231753349304

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.951
We'll give it a little folder icon because you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8814231753349304

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.199
just use emoji as the icon too.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9758932590484619

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.640
Why not?

NOTE Confidence: 0.39066198468208313

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.480
We'll reload this poo poo poo Doo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6606106758117676

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.400
There we are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.866054356098175

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.953
There's our so you can really decide if you want

NOTE Confidence: 0.866054356098175

00:09:18.002 --> 00:09:20.945
to have nested commands basically right that requires you to

NOTE Confidence: 0.866054356098175

00:09:20.994 --> 00:09:23.299
navigate 1 level deeper or really show it up at

NOTE Confidence: 0.866054356098175

00:09:23.348 --> 00:09:24.280
the most top level.

NOTE Confidence: 0.841188907623291

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.760
That's right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9441697597503662

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.555
You're really in charge of the whole context of your

NOTE Confidence: 0.9441697597503662

00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:28.200
app, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9258713126182556

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.078
If you want to put a whole bunch of items

NOTE Confidence: 0.9258713126182556

00:09:30.124 --> 00:09:32.323
in there, you probably want to nest them so that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9258713126182556

00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:34.384
the users go in there and then they know the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9258713126182556

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.080
context of what they're looking for.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8668917417526245

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.647
But if you have a bunch of different things, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8668917417526245

00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:41.001
know if you want to look for issues or pull

NOTE Confidence: 0.8668917417526245

00:09:41.054 --> 00:09:43.783
requests or repos, those are each kind of their own

NOTE Confidence: 0.8668917417526245

00:09:43.836 --> 00:09:44.960
separate page, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5554389357566833

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:45.320
Right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5440454483032227

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:45.920
Right, right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7218919396400452

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.800
So those sub commands, we can still add those let's.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8585079312324524

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.600
Do that, let's add more things, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8320093750953674

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.400
I don't always just want to open it up in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8320093750953674

00:09:52.444 --> 00:09:52.839
Explorer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8431988954544067

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.878
You know, probably want to open up this solution in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8431988954544067

00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:58.193
Visual Studio or I want to open it up in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8431988954544067

00:09:58.249 --> 00:09:59.039
the terminals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.918656587600708

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.896
So we'll go in here and we'll just add some

NOTE Confidence: 0.918656587600708

00:10:00.939 --> 00:10:01.760
more of those here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8966701626777649

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.443
And the way I'm going to do that is by

NOTE Confidence: 0.8966701626777649

00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:05.719
adding more commands.

NOTE Confidence: 0.847953736782074

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.160
Oh, so you can just nest them?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6541724801063538

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:07.880
Yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672232031822205

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:11.228
So your commands can have more commands, more things that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8672232031822205

00:10:11.274 --> 00:10:12.959
you can do with each of your things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8568370938301086

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.457
It's like a command section at some point, I guess,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8568370938301086

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:15.800
right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6809296607971191

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.280
Yeah, it's.

NOTE Confidence: 0.789047360420227

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.492
It's like a small command palette inside of a bigger

NOTE Confidence: 0.789047360420227

00:10:19.543 --> 00:10:20.360
command palette.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722484111785889

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.953
And this will ensure that once we select this, those

NOTE Confidence: 0.8722484111785889

00:10:24.008 --> 00:10:26.440
sub commands will just show up in that menu.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9680395126342773

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.480
That's right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8628458976745605

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.824
So if we go down here, I can press Control

NOTE Confidence: 0.8628458976745605

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.113
K and I can see all of these things that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8628458976745605

00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:34.905
the user can do right there in that little little

NOTE Confidence: 0.8628458976745605

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:35.239
menu.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7152997255325317

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.360
Does it even work or?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8194979429244995

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:37.960
Does it work?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5546625256538391

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.200
It does it work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7591086626052856

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.680
Thank you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.815779447555542

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.320
Thank you, Mike.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7472988367080688

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.800
I just want to double check that's.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5457775592803955

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.120
OK, come on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6437572836875916

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.440
Cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8846398591995239

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.504
So now that we've built our extension, how can we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8846398591995239

00:10:46.558 --> 00:10:47.320
distribute it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8901506066322327

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.643
Like, how can I make sure that my users know

NOTE Confidence: 0.8901506066322327

00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:51.280
how to find it and install it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9502235054969788

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.880
How does that work?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9140713214874268

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.840
That's a good question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8837332129478455

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.973
Usually when you build things, you want to build them

NOTE Confidence: 0.8837332129478455

00:10:55.011 --> 00:10:56.599
for other people to have them too, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8302930593490601

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.239
So you can take your extensions, you bundle them up

NOTE Confidence: 0.8302930593490601

00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:03.079
as an MSIX package just like any other app, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8685746788978577

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.640
And then you can upload them to Winget.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7851184010505676

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.904
And if you upload them into Winget, we can actually

NOTE Confidence: 0.7851184010505676

00:11:07.946 --> 00:11:09.880
find them right in the command palette itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8152576684951782

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.346
And here we have a big list of extensions for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8152576684951782

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.800
the command palette that There we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6620287895202637

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.120
There we go, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9003427624702454

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.840
This is all stuff that the community has built already.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8225749731063843

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:25.064
Or you can just upload it to the store, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8225749731063843

00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:27.860
know, and then you know users can find it right

NOTE Confidence: 0.8225749731063843

00:11:27.918 --> 00:11:29.199
here in the store too.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8111416697502136

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.644
Right now, what's actually nice, this week we're announcing that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8111416697502136

00:11:32.695 --> 00:11:36.082
the for individual developers, the onboarding fee in the Microsoft

NOTE Confidence: 0.8111416697502136

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:37.160
Store is going away.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8218006491661072

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.527
So creating an account on the Microsoft Store to submit

NOTE Confidence: 0.8218006491661072

00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:44.119
your apps or publishing manpower exchanges is now totally free.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7607669830322266

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.772
So that's pretty nice too that you can now just

NOTE Confidence: 0.7607669830322266

00:11:46.815 --> 00:11:47.799
deal with that as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8510903120040894

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:48.920
Cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676856756210327

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.120
Well, so how can I get started?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8087748885154724

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.160
We have some documentation I believe right that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6343696117401123

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.080
Folks, can we have some documentation?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9516900181770325

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.240
That's always fun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8429561257362366

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.350
So if you go to AKA miss command pal, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8429561257362366

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.959
can go check out the documentation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6108831763267517

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.982
I think we have a, we have a lead of

NOTE Confidence: 0.6108831763267517

00:12:08.045 --> 00:12:08.360
that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6913858652114868

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.280
Right, Yeah, if I just.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6004442572593689

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.520
Are you using command pal to?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7412618398666382

00:12:12.679 --> 00:12:14.983
Oh yeah, I just like parked the docs so I

NOTE Confidence: 0.7412618398666382

00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:17.455
can just pull up the docs and then there we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7412618398666382

00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:17.680
go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.717088520526886

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:19.248
They opened up on the other monitors, so I'm just

NOTE Confidence: 0.717088520526886

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.240
going to bring them over here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4847809076309204

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.200
Yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7561584115028381

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.360
So you can, you should definitely check out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.900678277015686

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.894
It has a bunch of samples on how to create

NOTE Confidence: 0.900678277015686

00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:29.574
some of these extensions and it does everything to basically

NOTE Confidence: 0.900678277015686

00:12:29.634 --> 00:12:30.600
get you started.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8947953581809998

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.906
And then the last thing that we should highlight is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8947953581809998

00:12:34.979 --> 00:12:39.340
on Wednesday, there's the breakout session done by Craig and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8947953581809998

00:12:39.412 --> 00:12:42.320
Kayla and Larry, some of the folks here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8321378231048584

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.573
And that will be all about all of the new

NOTE Confidence: 0.8321378231048584

00:12:44.617 --> 00:12:47.360
developer experiences that we're launching this week at Build.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718359470367432

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.200
So there will be a ton of cool stuff there

NOTE Confidence: 0.8718359470367432

00:12:50.248 --> 00:12:50.880
to check out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9070261716842651

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.920
And with that, I think we have two minutes left.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9175165891647339

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.880
So we actually did it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4274427890777588

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.320
So that's yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8450511693954468

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.646
So you can build an extension in like 13 minutes,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8450511693954468

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:56.879
not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.3713473677635193

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.520
15 yeah, including documentation, so that was good.

NOTE Confidence: 0.27242061495780945

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.040
Yep.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6690520644187927

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:00.400
Cool.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9070166349411011

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.324
Well, thank you all for attending and have a great

NOTE Confidence: 0.9070166349411011

00:13:02.361 --> 00:13:03.040
rest of the build.
