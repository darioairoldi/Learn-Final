# Passkey Authentication Information

## What are Passkeys?

Passkeys are a modern, secure authentication method that **completely replaces traditional passwords with cryptographic credentials**.<br>
They represent a revolutionary approach to user authentication, leveraging public-key cryptography to provide a **more secure**, **user-friendly**, and **phishing-resistant** authentication experience.

## How Passkeys Work

### Core Technology

Passkeys are built on the <mark style="background-color: lightyellow;" >**FIDO2/WebAuthn standard**</mark> and use **public-key cryptography** principles:

1. **Key Pair Generation**: When you create a passkey, your device generates a unique cryptographic key pair:
   - **Private Key**: Stored securely on your device (never leaves the device)
   - **Public Key**: Shared with the service you're registering with

2. **Authentication Process**: 
   - The service sends a <mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">challenge to your device</mark>
   - Your <mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">device uses the private key to sign the challenge
   - The <mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">service verifies the signature using the stored public key
   - If verification succeeds, you're authenticated

### Security Features

#### Phishing Resistance
- **Domain Binding**: Passkeys are cryptographically bound to specific domains
- **No Shared Secrets**: Unlike passwords, there's no secret that can be intercepted or stolen
- **Challenge-Response**: Each authentication uses a unique challenge, preventing replay attacks

#### Application Scoping
- **Site-Specific**: Each <mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">passkey is unique to the specific website or application
- **No Cross-Application Sharing**: A passkey for one service cannot be used for another
- **Isolation**: Compromising one service doesn't affect other services

**Important Clarification**: While each site requires its own unique passkey, this doesn't mean you need to authenticate every time you visit that site. The passkey is just the "key" - once you use it to unlock the door (authenticate), you stay "inside" (logged in) until the session expires.

### Passkeys vs. JWT Bearer Tokens: A Common Comparison

#### How Passkeys Are Similar to JWT Bearer Tokens
Many developers compare <mark style="background-color: lightyellow;">passkeys to JWT bearer tokens</mark>, and there are indeed some similarities:

- **Site-Specific**: Like JWT tokens, each passkey is unique to a specific site/application
- **No Cross-Site Usage**: Just like you can't use a JWT from Site A to authenticate to Site B
- **Authentication Proof**: Both prove identity to the target service
- **Stateless Authentication**: Both enable authentication without storing sensitive data server-side

however please consider they are fundamentally different in how they in their purpose and usage:
:
| Aspect | JWT Bearer Tokens | Passkeys |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Storage** | Often stored in browser/app memory | Stored securely in device hardware/OS |
| **Generation** | Generated by server after login | Generated by device during registration (and used during login) |
| **Transmission** | Sent with every API request | Only used during authentication ceremony |
| **Lifetime** | Have expiration times (minutes/hours) | Permanent until manually revoked |
| **Security** | Can be intercepted if not secured | Cryptographically impossible to intercept |
| **Usage Pattern** | Continuous usage for API calls | One-time usage for session establishment |

#### The Authentication Flow Comparison

**JWT Bearer Token Flow:**
1. Login with username/password → Server generates JWT
2. Store JWT in browser/app
3. Send JWT with every subsequent API request
4. Server validates JWT on each request

**Passkey Flow:**
1. One-time registration → Device generates key pair
2. Store private key securely on device
3. Authentication challenge → Sign with private key
4. Server validates signature → Creates normal web session (cookies)

#### Passkeys + JWT Tokens: Working Together

**Key Point**: Passkeys replace passwords for authentication, but servers can still generate JWT tokens afterward for API access - giving you secure login plus efficient ongoing communication.
