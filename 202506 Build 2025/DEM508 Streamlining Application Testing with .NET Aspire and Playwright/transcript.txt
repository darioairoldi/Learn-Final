00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.217
Hey there friends, Jeff Fritz here and I got a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8660306334495544

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:08.008
chance to speak at Microsoft Build about streamlining application testing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8660306334495544

00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:10.080
with.net Aspire and Playwright.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9390243291854858

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.831
And I want to recap and talk to you about

NOTE Confidence: 0.9390243291854858

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.989
that because there's some really cool tips that you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9390243291854858

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:18.640
learn from this demo that I think you can take

NOTE Confidence: 0.9390243291854858

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:21.628
advantage of, you can learn from, and I'm even going

NOTE Confidence: 0.9390243291854858

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:24.222
to give you the source code so you can tinker

NOTE Confidence: 0.9390243291854858

00:00:24.278 --> 00:00:26.760
with it at home or at the office afterwards.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8634178042411804

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.160
All right, let me show you what I'm talking about.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8008918166160583

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.520
soweknowthat.net Aspire.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4881238341331482

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.280
That's it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737524151802063

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.319
That set of libraries, frameworks and tools that that gives

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737524151802063

00:00:36.387 --> 00:00:41.864
you that stack for building observable, production ready distributed application

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737524151802063

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:42.960
systems, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9012449979782104

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.650
We get things like smart defaults and application orchestration, a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9012449979782104

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:53.763
cool developer dashboard, service discovery capabilities and great integrations using

NOTE Confidence: 0.9012449979782104

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:58.525
containers with all kinds of different databases and services that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9012449979782104

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:00.160
you already out there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8760048151016235

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.773
And we're going to take this and stitch it together

NOTE Confidence: 0.8760048151016235

00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:06.280
with Playwright and we've used Playwright.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8985933661460876

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.874
Playwright, for those of you that haven't tried it, is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8985933661460876

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:16.335
a cross-platform and cross browser testing framework that works with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8985933661460876

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:21.480
Chromium, Firefox, and Webkit across Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9232439994812012

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.520
It's fast, it's reliable, it's great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.960391640663147

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.891
You can use this to help with all of your

NOTE Confidence: 0.960391640663147

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:29.799
end to end testing capabilities.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804621696472168

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.128
It's got a great set of APIs that work in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804621696472168

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:37.356
all kinds of different languages, including NET and C, like

NOTE Confidence: 0.8804621696472168

00:01:37.427 --> 00:01:39.400
I'm going to use here today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9141706824302673

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.169
Now, of course, there's different types of tests that we're

NOTE Confidence: 0.9141706824302673

00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:46.080
going to work with as we're building our application systems.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9188810586929321

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.352
You might be familiar with unit testing or even doing

NOTE Confidence: 0.9188810586929321

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:52.495
a little bit of integration testing, but when I'm working

NOTE Confidence: 0.9188810586929321

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.879
with NET Aspire I want to do the third one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9729250073432922

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.080
Here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9099599719047546

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.128
I want to do some end to end testing to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9099599719047546

00:01:58.206 --> 00:02:03.288
validate the full application workflow because I might have other

NOTE Confidence: 0.9099599719047546

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:09.542
microservices, databases, and other capabilities all stitched together across a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9099599719047546

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.138
Net Aspire system that I want to use and test

NOTE Confidence: 0.9099599719047546

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:15.639
with something like Playwright.

NOTE Confidence: 0.932621419429779

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.813
So let me head over to the code and show

NOTE Confidence: 0.932621419429779

00:02:18.874 --> 00:02:21.830
you my sample code that will get you started with

NOTE Confidence: 0.932621419429779

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:25.029
understanding a little bit more about what we can do

NOTE Confidence: 0.932621419429779

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:26.960
with Net Aspire and Playwright.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9585701823234558

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.879
Here I am in Visual Studio Code and you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9585701823234558

00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:32.960
see my test project over there in the Explorer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.886148989200592

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.951
So I've written a couple of pieces here that I've

NOTE Confidence: 0.886148989200592

00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:41.276
labeled as infrastructure that set up and manage.net aspire and

NOTE Confidence: 0.886148989200592

00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:42.559
manage playwright.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9693282246589661

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.176
You'll be able to download and look further at these

NOTE Confidence: 0.9693282246589661

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:47.586
classes with the sample code that I'll give you at

NOTE Confidence: 0.9693282246589661

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:48.719
the end of the session.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9704968333244324

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.160
Now take a look here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9162423610687256

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920
This is my playwright manager.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811630606651306

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.654
This is what's going to manage my interactions with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811630606651306

00:02:55.716 --> 00:02:59.006
Playwright service so that we can go and and navigate

NOTE Confidence: 0.8811630606651306

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:01.799
a browser to explore our application system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8483169674873352

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.615
I've even got a property here that etu called is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8483169674873352

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:07.198
headless, and I'm going to set that U to just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8483169674873352

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:07.760
be false.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8752227425575256

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.474
I want to see the browser actually running for for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8752227425575256

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:12.160
the purposes of our demos here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8475512266159058

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.130
But when this initializes, it's going to go and set

NOTE Confidence: 0.8475512266159058

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:19.919
U some default timeouts, create access with Playwright.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8827775716781616

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.720
So it starts a browser for me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9092239737510681

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.175
And you can even see here, we're going to launch

NOTE Confidence: 0.9092239737510681

00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:29.077
the Chromium browser, that's the engine that runs both the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9092239737510681

00:03:29.143 --> 00:03:33.443
Google Chrome browser and our Microsoft Edge browser and interact

NOTE Confidence: 0.9092239737510681

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:36.420
with with whatever we send into it to go and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9092239737510681

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:37.280
navigate to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9478434324264526

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.351
I've also got my Aspire manager that I wrote here

NOTE Confidence: 0.9478434324264526

00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:44.987
that gets a reference to the Playwright manager and knows

NOTE Confidence: 0.9478434324264526

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.559
how to configure my distributed application for testing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9245480895042419

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.601
And then it gives me the ability to actually build

NOTE Confidence: 0.9245480895042419

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.593
that application so we can navigate and interact with it,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9245480895042419

00:03:56.662 --> 00:03:59.759
start it up and then it'll be running and our

NOTE Confidence: 0.9245480895042419

00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:01.480
tests can then interact.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603693246841431

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.560
And we of course have some dispose capabilities here to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603693246841431

00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.021
clean up our alication so that when we're done testing,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603693246841431

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.680
everything gets shut down properly for us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.888148844242096

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.927
Finally, I have some bass Playwright tests here that bring

NOTE Confidence: 0.888148844242096

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:20.239
everything together in this abstract class.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9308565855026245

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.617
This is the building block that all of my other

NOTE Confidence: 0.9308565855026245

00:04:23.684 --> 00:04:26.822
tests are built upon, and you can see it brings

NOTE Confidence: 0.9308565855026245

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.895
together my Aspire manager and my Playwright Manager so that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9308565855026245

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:34.366
those two pieces can work together and my tests can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9308565855026245

00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:38.305
tell Playwright how to find Aspire and navigate around the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9308565855026245

00:04:38.372 --> 00:04:38.840
system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9614701867103577

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.160
Let me show you a little bit further down here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.931959867477417

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.437
We have a configure method that does exactly those things

NOTE Confidence: 0.931959867477417

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:46.240
here, right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9048426151275635

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.256
It's going to go identify the URLs for where the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9048426151275635

00:04:49.314 --> 00:04:52.669
dashboard is running, pass along the information so we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9048426151275635

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:54.520
log into the dashboard as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8652377724647522

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.079
We can interact with pages using this method that that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8652377724647522

00:04:59.147 --> 00:05:02.786
takes a delegate here that takes takes a function that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8652377724647522

00:05:02.854 --> 00:05:06.628
defines exactly how to navigate around using some of our

NOTE Confidence: 0.8652377724647522

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:08.920
standard playwright test methods.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9530785083770752

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.483
And you can see here, it's actually going to go

NOTE Confidence: 0.9530785083770752

00:05:12.548 --> 00:05:15.851
and have things set up and navigate around and find

NOTE Confidence: 0.9530785083770752

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:19.413
the service that we want and interact with that inside

NOTE Confidence: 0.9530785083770752

00:05:19.478 --> 00:05:20.319
of our tests.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9709300398826599

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.600
So I have tests that are built over here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8240606784820557

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.805
This is my first set of tests called Weather Hub

NOTE Confidence: 0.8240606784820557

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:29.935
test because I'm, I'm going to work with a little

NOTE Confidence: 0.8240606784820557

00:05:29.998 --> 00:05:33.754
application that's set up to interact with the United States

NOTE Confidence: 0.8240606784820557

00:05:33.817 --> 00:05:37.949
National Weather Service's APIs and present the current weather to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8240606784820557

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:38.199
me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062187671661377

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.802
So I, I wrote a test here called search for

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062187671661377

00:05:41.872 --> 00:05:45.294
city and I'm using X units theory and inline data

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062187671661377

00:05:45.364 --> 00:05:48.925
capabilities as you see up here on lines 26 through

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062187671661377

00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:51.649
30 so that I can tell it go search for

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062187671661377

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.420
these terms and look for these cities, look for these

NOTE Confidence: 0.9062187671661377

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.680
weather stations that we want to see more information about.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9049264192581177

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.912
And our application is going to go find the My

NOTE Confidence: 0.9049264192581177

00:06:03.991 --> 00:06:08.571
Weather Hub application that Aspire is managing, go to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9049264192581177

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.519
root of that website and start navigating around.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9318397641181946

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.391
Click into the column options on a quick grid that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.9318397641181946

00:06:17.463 --> 00:06:21.532
in there and navigate through and actually search for one

NOTE Confidence: 0.9318397641181946

00:06:21.603 --> 00:06:24.744
of those cities and make sure that we we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.9318397641181946

00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:27.599
actually find that exact location text.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9298811554908752

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.400
Once we do, our test has passed and move on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7502123117446899

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.080
Not bad.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9528024196624756

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.856
Let me show you how this runs over here using

NOTE Confidence: 0.9528024196624756

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:38.520
the testing capabilities in Visual Studio Code.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9351819753646851

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.633
I'll just go to that search for city and click

NOTE Confidence: 0.9351819753646851

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:44.882
start on those tests and I'll move the browser over

NOTE Confidence: 0.9351819753646851

00:06:44.944 --> 00:06:47.943
here that Playwright is using so we can watch it

NOTE Confidence: 0.9351819753646851

00:06:48.005 --> 00:06:49.880
interact with the application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.937471866607666

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:58.881
Here it is starting the browser and there it is

NOTE Confidence: 0.937471866607666

00:06:58.945 --> 00:07:02.634
already into the website and you see it navigating around

NOTE Confidence: 0.937471866607666

00:07:02.698 --> 00:07:06.322
and closing the browser and reopening it as it navigates

NOTE Confidence: 0.937471866607666

00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:09.039
around and I can see in 17 seconds all of

NOTE Confidence: 0.937471866607666

00:07:09.104 --> 00:07:12.598
those searches worked exactly the way I expected it to

NOTE Confidence: 0.937471866607666

00:07:12.663 --> 00:07:16.157
and now it's cleaning up and shutting down the service

NOTE Confidence: 0.937471866607666

00:07:16.222 --> 00:07:17.839
for me in the background.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7186887264251709

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.080
Great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9104065299034119

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.805
But Playwright with Aspire can do more than just interact

NOTE Confidence: 0.9104065299034119

00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:28.940
with and and write some tests that we're working with

NOTE Confidence: 0.9104065299034119

00:07:29.017 --> 00:07:29.399
here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9227505326271057

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.295
We can actually use the Playwright MCP to interact and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9227505326271057

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:39.374
explore and do more discovery capabilities inside of our our

NOTE Confidence: 0.9227505326271057

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.039
application system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9209466576576233

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.083
So I wrote a prompt like this to to do

NOTE Confidence: 0.9209466576576233

00:07:44.154 --> 00:07:45.920
some exploratory testing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8173823356628418

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.001
Launch the app host project, navigate to the dashboard that's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8173823356628418

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.680
reported in the output with the direction, Log into dashboard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93723064661026

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.240
Make sure that the weather hub service is running.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9378694295883179

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.960
Open a browser to visit it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9294557571411133

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.008
This is a weather forecast page and wait for the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9294557571411133

00:08:03.068 --> 00:08:06.498
grid to finish loading with the locations, the city names

NOTE Confidence: 0.9294557571411133

00:08:06.558 --> 00:08:07.160
out there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9199236035346985

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.914
And we're going to click the button for the column

NOTE Confidence: 0.9199236035346985

00:08:09.964 --> 00:08:10.360
options.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9669508337974548

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.200
And let's search for Chicago.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9675869345664978

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.709
And let me know if you find any weather entries

NOTE Confidence: 0.9675869345664978

00:08:15.772 --> 00:08:16.399
out there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9292784929275513

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.054
So I'll just click start here with Copilot in Visual

NOTE Confidence: 0.9292784929275513

00:08:21.132 --> 00:08:24.796
Studio Code and it's going to start the MCP and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9292784929275513

00:08:24.874 --> 00:08:26.200
interact with it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.951132595539093

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.126
So first, of course, it's going to run the application

NOTE Confidence: 0.951132595539093

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:29.560
for us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9528427124023438

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.026
So you see there, it's going to run it down

NOTE Confidence: 0.9528427124023438

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:34.319
here in my Visual Studio Code terminal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.959410548210144

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.316
And once it's done, it's going to find where that

NOTE Confidence: 0.959410548210144

00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:41.200
dashboard is running.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8463965058326721

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.931
Wants to wait a little bit here, so we'll let

NOTE Confidence: 0.8463965058326721

00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:45.999
it finish loading.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9754815697669983

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.360
There we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9499305486679077

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.080
It's found the dashboard URL.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9496063590049744

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.367
It's opening that up and we can see down here

NOTE Confidence: 0.9496063590049744

00:08:53.434 --> 00:08:55.440
it's going to take a snapshot.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9528283476829529

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.871
It's going to look at the dashboard here for us

NOTE Confidence: 0.9528283476829529

00:08:58.944 --> 00:09:02.667
and now it knows where the website is, navigates to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9528283476829529

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:02.960
it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9164978861808777

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.127
And now it's actually going to start interacting with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9164978861808777

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:06.960
website for us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9396476149559021

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.634
And we can see it over there on the left

NOTE Confidence: 0.9396476149559021

00:09:09.697 --> 00:09:12.400
side doing this exploratory testing for us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9408747553825378

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.252
It's having a problem identifying exactly the access it needs

NOTE Confidence: 0.9408747553825378

00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:21.200
to that button.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9159569144248962

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.280
So it's trying again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9284657835960388

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.280
There it is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118397831916809

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.478
It found the search button and now it's actually going

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118397831916809

00:09:27.549 --> 00:09:31.032
to search for Chicago and there it is and there's

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118397831916809

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:34.799
no values for Chicago and it's, it's going to report

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118397831916809

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.566
that back to me here that there's zero items instead

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118397831916809

00:09:38.637 --> 00:09:42.049
of the original 3600 and it doesn't know what to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9118397831916809

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.760
do there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9266952872276306

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.061
It's going to clean up and stop the application for

NOTE Confidence: 0.9266952872276306

00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:46.320
us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9656481742858887

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.840
That's great.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8648092746734619

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.132
We did a little bit of exploratory testing there and,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8648092746734619

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:58.838
and it worked for us to go and discover exactly

NOTE Confidence: 0.8648092746734619

00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:03.239
how our application would interact with playwright here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8680051565170288

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.880
Really neat stuff.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9343180060386658

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.196
But that's some valuable content that we saw there that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9343180060386658

00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:11.287
it did handle the search properly when it couldn't find

NOTE Confidence: 0.9343180060386658

00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:11.840
anything.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9219204187393188

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.800
So let me just, let me just codify that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9617705941200256

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.160
Let's turn that into a test, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9210669994354248

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.539
Let's turn that exploration into a test that verifies when

NOTE Confidence: 0.9210669994354248

00:10:22.599 --> 00:10:26.400
a location doesn't exist, that the website handles it properly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.823031485080719

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.690
And I've already got some tests out there and they're

NOTE Confidence: 0.823031485080719

00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:32.279
saved in a file called Weather Hub Tests CS.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9383015632629395

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.293
So I'll tell it to run that prompt in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9383015632629395

00:10:35.358 --> 00:10:36.200
current chat.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9531839489936829

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.919
Just continue on there and let's see what it's able

NOTE Confidence: 0.9531839489936829

00:10:39.992 --> 00:10:43.200
to generate for us so that we can extend our

NOTE Confidence: 0.9531839489936829

00:10:43.273 --> 00:10:48.160
test capabilities that are interacting with our larger application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9366198182106018

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:52.809
So you can see here it's parsing and looking at

NOTE Confidence: 0.9366198182106018

00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:56.587
that test file for us and now it thinks it

NOTE Confidence: 0.9366198182106018

00:10:56.675 --> 00:11:00.628
knows how to do it and it's going to generate

NOTE Confidence: 0.9366198182106018

00:11:00.716 --> 00:11:03.440
a test for us inside the class.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9714703559875488

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.540
There we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9169975519180298

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.008
We can see it's doing the exact same things that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9169975519180298

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.549
it was doing in the previous test and it cleaned

NOTE Confidence: 0.9169975519180298

00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:20.500
up some of its code there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9435968399047852

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:26.043
I'm going to remove this little bit because I think

NOTE Confidence: 0.9435968399047852

00:11:26.112 --> 00:11:28.860
we only need one test that is down here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9244466423988342

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.491
So let's run it with the rest of our other

NOTE Confidence: 0.9244466423988342

00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:32.839
tests.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8226104974746704

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.250
Here it is, search for nonexistent location.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9511634707450867

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.490
I'll let it run that test.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9576436281204224

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.324
We can see it built properly down here in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9576436281204224

00:11:53.383 --> 00:11:54.810
terminal and here we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8664459586143494

00:11:54.809 --> 00:11:59.364
It's going to spin, starts up the application and it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8664459586143494

00:11:59.448 --> 00:12:03.750
going to walk through that test scenario for us and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8664459586143494

00:12:03.834 --> 00:12:05.689
the test ran properly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.92036372423172

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.370
Fantastic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.936478316783905

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.887
Now we've got the test running properly and we can

NOTE Confidence: 0.936478316783905

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:16.161
run all of our tests here, but let's actually modify

NOTE Confidence: 0.936478316783905

00:12:16.222 --> 00:12:19.557
the application and make sure that it still works when

NOTE Confidence: 0.936478316783905

00:12:19.619 --> 00:12:21.040
we add our new feature.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8886927962303162

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.403
So I happen to have already started down the process

NOTE Confidence: 0.8886927962303162

00:12:25.479 --> 00:12:29.327
of building a feature that's going to work with our

NOTE Confidence: 0.8886927962303162

00:12:29.402 --> 00:12:33.854
application that will go summarize the first day of weather

NOTE Confidence: 0.8886927962303162

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.929
forecast data and to set up a background image behind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8886927962303162

00:12:38.004 --> 00:12:41.550
our forecast that kind of fits the vibe for the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8886927962303162

00:12:41.626 --> 00:12:44.720
the type of weather that we're expecting.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9388857483863831

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.624
And it's going to use a little bit of Azure

NOTE Confidence: 0.9388857483863831

00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:50.920
Open AI services to reach out and interact with that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.945071816444397

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.067
You can learn more about how this summarizer works when

NOTE Confidence: 0.945071816444397

00:12:54.113 --> 00:12:56.244
you see the source code that I'm going to give

NOTE Confidence: 0.945071816444397

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.680
you at the end of the session.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8810614347457886

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.148
So it's just going to reach out, put that summary

NOTE Confidence: 0.8810614347457886

00:13:01.209 --> 00:13:04.015
into, into a, a property here for us and it'll

NOTE Confidence: 0.8810614347457886

00:13:04.076 --> 00:13:06.759
format the background based on that summary.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9517806768417358

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.517
I can go back over to my tests and now

NOTE Confidence: 0.9517806768417358

00:13:09.574 --> 00:13:12.300
I can run all the tests, including those where I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9517806768417358

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:13.720
do actually have a city.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9579553604125977

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.152
And I'll know immediately if if I didn't break my

NOTE Confidence: 0.9579553604125977

00:13:17.218 --> 00:13:18.000
application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9427536129951477

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.433
And I can then go through and actually look at

NOTE Confidence: 0.9427536129951477

00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:25.523
what this this experience is after we're done running through

NOTE Confidence: 0.9427536129951477

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:27.039
all of our tests here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8566986322402954

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.016
Now, of course, in in a CICD scenario, I wouldn't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8566986322402954

00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:33.560
have the browser display for us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9669833183288574

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.520
I would turn that off.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9343294501304626

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.242
But for this demo, it's kind of neat to see

NOTE Confidence: 0.9343294501304626

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.360
it navigate through and interact with all the things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93603515625

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.480
And there we go in about 20 seconds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.966117799282074

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.029
We know that we didn't break anything inside of our

NOTE Confidence: 0.966117799282074

00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:46.679
application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8806461095809937

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.276
So I can, I can, I can stop everything here

NOTE Confidence: 0.8806461095809937

00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:54.441
and head back over to PowerShell, start my system and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8806461095809937

00:13:54.518 --> 00:13:58.297
actually take a look at what this what this looks

NOTE Confidence: 0.8806461095809937

00:13:58.374 --> 00:13:58.759
like.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6236435770988464

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.680
So there's my aspired dashboard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9379894137382507

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.621
I'll click into my weather application and I'll give it

NOTE Confidence: 0.9379894137382507

00:14:35.693 --> 00:14:38.560
a try here by searching for my hometown.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9559310674667358

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.401
I'll search for my hometown, Philadelphia, and there it is

NOTE Confidence: 0.9559310674667358

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.919
when I click into it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8639385104179382

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.695
Here's the weather forecast for for this week and you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8639385104179382

00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:51.159
can see it's it today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693675398826599

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.102
It's going to be sunny, a little hazy, hot with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693675398826599

00:14:54.165 --> 00:14:55.480
highs in the mid 80s.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9387896060943604

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.760
That's of course Fahrenheit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9504368305206299

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.593
We use Fahrenheit here in the States and I get

NOTE Confidence: 0.9504368305206299

00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:02.919
a nice sunny background image based on that forecast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9582474827766418

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.960
Really cool stuff.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8854534029960632

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.483
I had Playwright and Aspire help me test and verify

NOTE Confidence: 0.8854534029960632

00:15:08.545 --> 00:15:11.523
that this application is going to work well as a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8854534029960632

00:15:11.585 --> 00:15:15.494
complete system that knows how to communicate and interact with

NOTE Confidence: 0.8854534029960632

00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:18.968
the National Weather Service API and cache some of that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8854534029960632

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.759
stuff using a Redis cache in the background.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9416379928588867

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.641
Let me head back to the slides and get you

NOTE Confidence: 0.9416379928588867

00:15:24.688 --> 00:15:27.023

with Playwright.
