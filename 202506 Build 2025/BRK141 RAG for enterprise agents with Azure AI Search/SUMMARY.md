## Key Topics Covered

### ?? **1. The Evolution Beyond Traditional RAG**

#### The Historical Context: Two Years of RAG Progress
**Pablo's Opening Insight:**
> "About two years ago, we started to talk about RAG... it was built out of the tools available in the room. There was this clever observation of in-context learning... we managed to put these things together."

**Traditional RAG Architecture:**
- **In-context learning** - Language models with concatenated retrieved content
- **Available tools approach** - Using existing search stacks not designed for AI
- **Vector search adoption** - Addressing vocabulary gaps and semantic understanding
- **Industry success** - Two years of progress with first-wave applications

#### The Transition to Purpose-Built Systems
**From Adoption to Innovation:**
- **Historical approach** - "Whatever we adopted to do the job"
- **Current evolution** - "Things that we purposely built and constructed"
- **Strategic goal** - Make tasks easier, better, and faster to solution
- **Enterprise focus** - Real-world agents solving real-world problems

### ?? **2. Agentic Retrieval: The Next Generation Query Pipeline**

#### The Limitation of Single-Shot Search
**Traditional Search Constraints:**
- **Linear results** - Top-K results from single query execution
- **Simple fact-seeking** works well: "What are the security updates for KB article #123456?"
- **Complex queries fail** - Multi-part questions with typos, references, and context

**The "Doesn't Work" Scenario Example:**
```
Complex Query: "What does KB [typo] article fix security issue mentioned earlier 
regarding the vulnerability we discussed?"

Challenges:
- Multiple moving parts in single question
- Typos requiring correction
- Cross-references requiring resolution
- Conversational context dependency
```

#### Agentic Retrieval Architecture
**Revolutionary Approach:**
```
Traditional: User Query ? Single Search ? Top-K Results ? LLM
Agentic: Chat History + Context ? Query Planning ? Parallel Execution ? Merge Results ? LLM
```

**Intelligent Query Processing:**
- **Query planning** - LLM-powered understanding of information needs
- **Query decomposition** - Breaking complex queries into retrievable components
- **Typo correction** - Context-aware error resolution
- **Parallel execution** - Multiple search operations simultaneously
- **Result merging** - Intelligent combination of diverse information sources

#### Live Demonstration: Outdoor Gear Analysis
**Complex Query Scenario:**
```
User: "What are examples of popular tents?"
System: "TrailMaster and SkyView are two popular choices."
User: "Which one fits more people?"
```

**Agentic Processing:**
1. **Context analysis** - Understanding previous conversation about tent models
2. **Query branching** - Two separate searches:
   - "TrailMaster tent maximum capacity"
   - "SkyView tent maximum capacity"
3. **Parallel execution** - Both queries processed simultaneously
4. **Result synthesis** - Combined capacity information in comparative format

#### Performance Metrics and Validation
**Quantified Improvements:**
- **40% increase in answer relevance** for complex queries
- **30% increase in result rate** for difficult question scenarios
- **Multi-dataset validation** - Support, MIML (Multi-Industry Multi-Language)
- **Groundedness preservation** - No regression in hallucination prevention

**Evaluation Framework:**
- **Content relevance** - Retrieved information matches query intent
- **Answer relevance** - LLM response addresses actual question
- **Groundedness** - Response based on retrieved data, not hallucinated

### ?? **3. Multi-Modal Document Processing Revolution**

#### Beyond Simple Text Chunking
**Traditional RAG Data Problems:**
- **500-token chunking** - Arbitrary text segmentation ignoring document structure
- **Text-only processing** - Missing critical visual information
- **Layout ignorance** - Losing contextual relationships and hierarchies

#### Advanced Document Intelligence
**Real-World Document Challenges:**
- **Complex schematics** - Arrows, text boxes, and diagram relationships
- **Multi-modal content** - Text and images requiring coordinated understanding

#### AI-Powered Processing Pipeline
**End-to-End Document Processing:**
1. **AI Document Intelligence** - Automatic layout and structure extraction
2. **Image verbalization** - LLM-powered image description generation
3. **Multi-modal embeddings** - Coordinated text and visual understanding
4. **Component addressability** - Individual images and sections for citation
5. **Sophisticated chunking** - Structure-aware content segmentation

## Implementation Guide

### Getting Started with Agentic Retrieval

#### 1. Knowledge Agent Creation
```python
# Create Knowledge Agent
knowledge_agent = search_client.create_knowledge_agent(
    name="product_agent",
    data_sources=["contoso_products_index"],
    model="gpt-4o",
    policy={
        "relevance_threshold": 0.7,
        "max_queries": 5
    }
)

# Use Agent for Retrieval
response = knowledge_agent.retrieve(
    chat_history=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are popular tents?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "TrailMaster and SkyView..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Which fits more people?"}
    ]
