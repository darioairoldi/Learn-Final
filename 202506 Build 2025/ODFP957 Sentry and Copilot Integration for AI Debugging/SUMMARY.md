# Session Goal 

Weâ€™re in the era of the vibe code. More people are building applications, and breaking them, than ever before. GitHub Copilot gives your editor a window into all the context that Sentry builds around issues in your environment. In this video, Cody will show you how you can get started using the Sentry Copilot extension to vibe debug broken code as fast as you can build it. 


# Session AI Summary
Introduction to Workflow: Cody De Arkland from Sentry introduces the session by discussing Sentry's debugging and troubleshooting processes within applications. The focus is on integrating GitHub Copilot and Sentry for enhancing developer experience and workflow efficiency.



Demonstration of Features: Cody demonstrates various Sentry features using a sample application, highlighting how GitHub integrates into Sentry's operations. He showcases the activation of a feature flag leading to an error, emphasizing the role of Sentry's toolbar and the debugging process that follows.



Debugging with Copilot: The discussion shifts towards using GitHub Copilot for debugging. Cody explains how developers can interact with Sentry using Copilot directly within VS Code, demonstrating commands to retrieve and manage issues, thereby facilitating a streamlined troubleshooting process.



Root Cause Analysis and Autofix: Cody illustrates how Sentry pinpoints problems by initiating a root cause analysis with an AI tool named Seer, which proposes potential fixes. This section delves into the benefits of integrating Sentry with autofix capabilities, showing how it predicts and suggests solutions, potentially creating pull requests on GitHub to implement fixes.



Integration of Technologies: The synergy between GitHub, Sentry, and AI tools like Seer and Copilot is underscored, highlighting how they collectively aid in diagnosing and resolving coding issues directly from the development environment or through detailed error tracing in Sentry.



Conclusion and Invitation for Engagement: Cody concludes by stressing Sentry's commitment to simplifying the developer's workflow when handling application errors. He encourages viewers to reach out with questions or for assistance in integrating these tools, aiming to foster a supportive community for developers.
