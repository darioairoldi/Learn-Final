NOTE Confidence: 0.9675599336624146

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.240
Thank you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8583706617355347

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.160
Thanks everyone for coming.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056358337402344

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.217
I know it's getting late in the day and it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056358337402344

00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:06.953
been a long week, but we've got a few more

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056358337402344

00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:07.600
sessions to go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8754815459251404

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.807
But either said thank you for joining us and I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8754815459251404

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:12.400
have been challenged to do some juggling throughout this session.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7501922249794006

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.227
So that's really why you're going to want to stick

NOTE Confidence: 0.7501922249794006

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:14.520
around.

NOTE Confidence: 0.791964590549469

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.320
But we've got short on time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9455589056015015

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.400
So let's crack on and talk about Foundry Local.

NOTE Confidence: 0.918207049369812

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.098
Hey everybody, how many of you are doing any kind

NOTE Confidence: 0.918207049369812

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:22.320
of generative AI right now?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8400754332542419

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.040
Are you doing it on locally or in the cloud?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5957115888595581

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.080
Locally?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8971934914588928

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.293
Well, if you are not familiar with the challenges between

NOTE Confidence: 0.8971934914588928

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:34.541
running things in the cloud and locally, running things locally

NOTE Confidence: 0.8971934914588928

00:00:34.592 --> 00:00:35.760
on a device is is hard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8716912269592285

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.597
And you know, we are get spoiled when we run

NOTE Confidence: 0.8716912269592285

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:40.080
models on on the cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9475660920143127

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.148
First of all, one of the challenges of running it

NOTE Confidence: 0.9475660920143127

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.063
on the cloud is you have to pay a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.9475660920143127

00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:45.920
of money, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8949723839759827

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.680
So when you try to get a model on your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8949723839759827

00:00:47.727 --> 00:00:49.720
device locally, that's your, it's for free.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9301903247833252

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.120
You're running it on your device for free.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8299786448478699

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.669
At the same time, you're also keeping a lot of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8299786448478699

00:00:53.718 --> 00:00:55.560
the information on your device, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.5830524563789368

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.280
You aren't sending it to someone else's cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8877824544906616

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.245
You know where the data is, you know where it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8877824544906616

00:00:59.284 --> 00:00:59.520
lives.

NOTE Confidence: 0.756737232208252

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.960
So it's all keeping on the on the device.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7670661211013794

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.240
You have full control over that data.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9266886115074158

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.760
At the same time, you're not depending on the network.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9447748064994812

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.058
It all runs on that device and you are in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9447748064994812

00:01:07.112 --> 00:01:09.548
control of how fast the data can go and based

NOTE Confidence: 0.9447748064994812

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.279
on the device hardware as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.817176342010498

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.240
And it all can run offline, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8651784658432007

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.440
You're not depending on the cloud.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8505038619041443

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.778
So you can run offline and then you're not worried

NOTE Confidence: 0.8505038619041443

00:01:16.825 --> 00:01:19.397
about any kind of quota or trolling because you control

NOTE Confidence: 0.8505038619041443

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:20.519
that device completely.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8044857978820801

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.200
However, there's some challenges when running things online, running locally,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8044857978820801

00:01:26.242 --> 00:01:28.600
for example, there are some hardware constraints, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9278656244277954

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.840
You can't run any model on any hardware.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9199839234352112

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.440
These models are are very big, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9192379117012024

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.760
And they can take up a lot of memory.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8525427579879761

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.512
So you need to make sure that the device you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.8525427579879761

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.413
running this model on has the right hardware to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8525427579879761

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240
able to run that model size that you're looking.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7321924567222595

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.022
So you limit it to the size of the model

NOTE Confidence: 0.7321924567222595

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:44.360
you're running based on that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7068793177604675

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.120
At the same time, there's different types of hardware.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9124188423156738

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.479
So if you're reaching millions of people, they all have

NOTE Confidence: 0.9124188423156738

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:50.679
different types of devices.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9291926026344299

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.484
So how do you send the right model to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9291926026344299

00:01:52.523 --> 00:01:54.479
right device and how do you get that there, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9358044266700745

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.520
How do you how do you maintain the right models?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9185885787010193

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.192
How do you decide which model to run when and

NOTE Confidence: 0.9185885787010193

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.440
how as part of that?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8773903250694275

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.965
And the same time, different models, different frameworks have different

NOTE Confidence: 0.8773903250694275

00:02:04.013 --> 00:02:05.640
capabilities of different systems.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9673399925231934

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.040
So how do you work around that?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9355335831642151

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.600
So there's a lot of work you have to do

NOTE Confidence: 0.9355335831642151

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.960
to kind of manage this across all those different devices.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9114538431167603

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.193
So to help with that, we came out with Foundry

NOTE Confidence: 0.9114538431167603

00:02:14.248 --> 00:02:17.089
Local, which allows you to deliver the best model to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9114538431167603

00:02:17.144 --> 00:02:17.799
your device.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734095096588135

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.123
It is a service that runs locally in a device

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734095096588135

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:22.566
that can decide what's the right model to run on

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734095096588135

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:24.960
top of your onto a device that it's running on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282173871994019

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.744
You as a developer, you just request a certain model

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282173871994019

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:30.576
and then Foundry Local decides what that model is, where

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282173871994019

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:32.912
it's running on the GPUCPU or even NPU as part

NOTE Confidence: 0.8282173871994019

00:02:32.962 --> 00:02:33.360
of that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8808150291442871

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.330
And we run the model that's the best optimized for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8808150291442871

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.320
that device that supports the right quantization and you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8808150291442871

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.771
run on the right hardware whether you have a good

NOTE Confidence: 0.8808150291442871

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.360
GPU or not.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7251017093658447

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.621
We also found your local supports running these malls for

NOTE Confidence: 0.7251017093658447

00:02:46.673 --> 00:02:46.880
you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7725452184677124

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.716
So it spins up a whole service that is open

NOTE Confidence: 0.7725452184677124

00:02:49.782 --> 00:02:50.639
AI compliant.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7961864471435547

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.837
So that way you can use the same same frameworks

NOTE Confidence: 0.7961864471435547

00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:55.309
you're using with Open AI or all the other frameworks

NOTE Confidence: 0.7961864471435547

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:58.239
to just call into this local Http://endpoint that you're using.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8907345533370972

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.108
So for example, in this code here, you can see

NOTE Confidence: 0.8907345533370972

00:03:01.171 --> 00:03:04.040
here we're using the C# SDK with Fondue local.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7419067621231079

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.080
We're importing the Microsoft dot AI dot fondue local namespace.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8823862075805664

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.122
We're saying we want to use the Quan 2.5 model,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8823862075805664

00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:13.759
the five, the 0.5 billion parameter model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8644888401031494

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.033
We're starting a new fondue manager to with that model

NOTE Confidence: 0.8644888401031494

00:03:17.087 --> 00:03:19.461
name, and then we just get a model client to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8644888401031494

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:22.159
be able to start calling it just the same pattern

NOTE Confidence: 0.8644888401031494

00:03:22.213 --> 00:03:23.399
they might be used to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9075900316238403

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.434
However, a lot of the challenges here are now you're

NOTE Confidence: 0.9075900316238403

00:03:26.481 --> 00:03:29.907
managing an application, you're managing a model within the application,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9075900316238403

00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:32.429
as well as trying to be the application that's using

NOTE Confidence: 0.9075900316238403

00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:32.999
this model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7715282440185547

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.152
And that's where Eric here can help us solve that

NOTE Confidence: 0.7715282440185547

00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:36.680
problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9276377558708191

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.720
Yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8200660347938538

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.908
So in a a distributed application, which any application that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8200660347938538

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.416
consists of some kind of, you know, a front end

NOTE Confidence: 0.8200660347938538

00:03:43.468 --> 00:03:46.134
or a service, something like that, and some kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8200660347938538

00:03:46.186 --> 00:03:48.433
and like a database or in this case a model

NOTE Confidence: 0.8200660347938538

00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:52.039
like that's a distributed application, you've got multiple services.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8105146884918213

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.486
And for for that, like you're really going to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.8105146884918213

00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:57.060
juggling, hey, I threw in that analogy, you're going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8105146884918213

00:03:57.105 --> 00:03:59.771
end up juggling a whole bunch of different things together

NOTE Confidence: 0.8105146884918213

00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:01.840
thatswhere.net Aspire can come, can come in.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9082176685333252

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.050
So in the previous example, the application was doing both

NOTE Confidence: 0.9082176685333252

00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:07.969
the model download and management of the service as well

NOTE Confidence: 0.9082176685333252

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.840
as consuming it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9123283624649048

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.320
With Aspire, we separate that out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8508764505386353

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.732
We have our app host, which is responsible for orchestrating

NOTE Confidence: 0.8508764505386353

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:18.088
the model download and and engaging with the Foundry local

NOTE Confidence: 0.8508764505386353

00:04:18.144 --> 00:04:18.599
service.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9508947134017944

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.920
And then we have our client application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594886660575867

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.405
So in this case, it's going to be a web

NOTE Confidence: 0.8594886660575867

00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:23.919
application that's going to consume that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7813162803649902

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.272
In this case, it's going to use the Microsoft Extensions,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7813162803649902

00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:30.565
a Microsoft Azure inference SDK rather than the Open AI

NOTE Confidence: 0.7813162803649902

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:33.682
SDK, just because I wanted to show the the different

NOTE Confidence: 0.7813162803649902

00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:34.800
styles of interop.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7717472910881042

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.521
Then we're then turning into a set of interfaces available

NOTE Confidence: 0.7717472910881042

00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:39.841
through Microsoft Extensions AI so that we can do things

NOTE Confidence: 0.7717472910881042

00:04:39.882 --> 00:04:42.040
like functioning vacation and and so on and so forth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8977676630020142

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.680
But you're here for a demo.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7461723685264587

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.301
You're not just here to see us juggle and do

NOTE Confidence: 0.7461723685264587

00:04:48.353 --> 00:04:48.720
slides.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8778021335601807

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.442
So let's jump over to Visual Studio where I've I've

NOTE Confidence: 0.8778021335601807

00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:57.000
got an application I've created using the Microsoft Extensions AI

NOTE Confidence: 0.8778021335601807

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:57.759
templates.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8511925339698792

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.738
So this is just a template application that I've, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8511925339698792

00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:03.435
know, found new in Visual Studio, but I want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8511925339698792

00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:04.839
add foundry local to it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999490141868591

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.691
So I've got the aspire integration enabled as well for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8999490141868591

00:05:07.728 --> 00:05:07.840
it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8158295750617981

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.213
So I'm going to come to our post here and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8158295750617981

00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:12.240
I'm going to add a Nugent package.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9055866003036499

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.253
So this is the foundry hosting integration because I'm hosting

NOTE Confidence: 0.9055866003036499

00:05:16.313 --> 00:05:17.999
foundry local in my outpost.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7497968673706055

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.220
Now this is a pre released new package and I

NOTE Confidence: 0.7497968673706055

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:22.160
making sure that the demo is going to work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.745679497718811

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.629
It is running off like entirely off my machine, not

NOTE Confidence: 0.745679497718811

00:05:24.677 --> 00:05:25.839
off the the nugget feed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.877244770526886

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.515
We're working with the team to get this out and

NOTE Confidence: 0.877244770526886

00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:29.119
available so that you can use it yourselves.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8732336759567261

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.712
But let's add this to our our outpost and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8732336759567261

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.275
come into the outpost here and say, well, I'm going

NOTE Confidence: 0.8732336759567261

00:05:36.344 --> 00:05:38.879
to want to create a foundry resource.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8597142696380615

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.160
So in a spy, we call these resources.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8098592162132263

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160
So I'm foundry resource.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6117327213287354

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.040
So I'm on the builder.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9044978022575378

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.320
I want to add a Foundry local resource called.

NOTE Confidence: 0.877656877040863

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.560
I give it a name, we'll call it AI.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9616492986679077

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400
And then on this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9563084840774536

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.696
So this is kind of like that start service sort

NOTE Confidence: 0.9563084840774536

00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:54.800
of thing from the SDK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8677095174789429

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.989
But with it, I then want to say the I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8677095174789429

00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:01.231
want a say chat model and I'm going to say

NOTE Confidence: 0.8677095174789429

00:06:01.307 --> 00:06:03.719
Foundry add a model with a name.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9600935578346252

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.623
So this is like the deployment name you would have

NOTE Confidence: 0.9600935578346252

00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:06.080
in Foundry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7778317928314209

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.949
So we'll call this chat because it's role is going

NOTE Confidence: 0.7778317928314209

00:06:07.983 --> 00:06:08.360
to be chat.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9454905986785889

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.240
And then what is the model family I want?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8296796083450317

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.900
So Quinn 2.5 Dash 0.5 B so that then specifying

NOTE Confidence: 0.8296796083450317

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:17.549
the model for then foundry local to work out the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8296796083450317

00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:19.559
right one for my hardware.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8310484886169434

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.250
Is it going to be a CPU or GPU or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8310484886169434

00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:22.480
an NPU enabled version?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9581888914108276

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.359
Now the last thing I want to do is I

NOTE Confidence: 0.9581888914108276

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:26.840
want to add it as a reference.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6914642453193665

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.720
I want to sorry with reference.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9370999336242676

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.210
So I'm passing that reference to this resource across to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9370999336242676

00:06:32.265 --> 00:06:33.479
my client application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8288758397102356

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.480
There's the chat model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.3396996259689331

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.880
Thanks for getting up to go part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9440728425979614

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.377
And then because I need that model to be downloaded

NOTE Confidence: 0.9440728425979614

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.762
before my application can start, I can also say wait

NOTE Confidence: 0.9440728425979614

00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:44.039
for the chat model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8417811989784241

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.833
So then my web application won't get us get started

NOTE Confidence: 0.8417811989784241

00:06:47.893 --> 00:06:51.448
by the Aspire app host, our orchestrator of our distributed

NOTE Confidence: 0.8417811989784241

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.040
application until that model is available.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9392667412757874

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.280
Now I have actually already downloaded this model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9156019687652588

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.140
So you're not going to see that in run in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9156019687652588

00:06:58.186 --> 00:06:58.639
real time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.854106068611145

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.910
I didn't want to rely on conference Wi-Fi downloading model

NOTE Confidence: 0.854106068611145

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.360
over it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801808953285217

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.699
It's it would be a little bit of, well, I'd

NOTE Confidence: 0.8801808953285217

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:06.559
have to do a lot of juggling for that one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8551227450370789

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.400
You have the time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6210311651229858

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.000
I, I I could have do I say do we?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8032633662223816

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.880
Do we want to try it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7961757779121399

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.421
Do we want to delete the model of my local

NOTE Confidence: 0.7961757779121399

00:07:12.455 --> 00:07:12.759
occasion?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8292005658149719

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.960
Try and download it real time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7186654210090637

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.623
I I'm I'm hearing a lot of goes goes to

NOTE Confidence: 0.7186654210090637

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:16.879
that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5809544920921326

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.480
OK, so we go to foundry cache, cache R.E.M.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8965772390365601

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.560
All right, If this doesn't work, I'm blaming the audience.

NOTE Confidence: 0.778289258480072

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.320
No, it's my fault.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7144055962562561

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.125
Actually, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm blaming my speaker, but you,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7144055962562561

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:29.800
you enable him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5231263041496277

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.360
I, I heard yes, he's coming at me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7402662634849548

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.240
All right, no pressure, no pressure, no pressure.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7536300420761108

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.866
All right well, I've got no recovery path if this

NOTE Confidence: 0.7536300420761108

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.479
doesn't work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7628597021102905

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.888
So then on my client application, my my web application,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7628597021102905

00:07:41.943 --> 00:07:44.479
I'm going to add the, the, the Nugent package.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7619463801383972

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.955
Oops, not from Nugent from my, my downloaded version of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7619463801383972

00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:48.840
the packages.

NOTE Confidence: 0.854887068271637

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.219
So I'm going to add the Aspire Azure AI inference

NOTE Confidence: 0.854887068271637

00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:52.840
package.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9153386950492859

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.200
So this is just a thin veneer around the that

NOTE Confidence: 0.9153386950492859

00:07:56.269 --> 00:08:00.430
Nugent package for Azure AI inference, which means that it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.9153386950492859

00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:03.828
going to understand when I say builder, I want a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9153386950492859

00:08:03.897 --> 00:08:07.434
chat completions client and I want to use that chat

NOTE Confidence: 0.9153386950492859

00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:07.919
model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7866020798683167

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.010
So that's the one that I defined in my my

NOTE Confidence: 0.7866020798683167

00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:10.520
app host.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8523010611534119

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.105
Let's turn that into a Microsoft Extensions AI, and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8523010611534119

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.760
we're going to say use function calling.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8762387037277222

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.920
Let's go function calling.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8284164071083069

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.130
And then we're going to say use open telemetry so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8284164071083069

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:25.982
we can get some rich diagnostic logging, which is another

NOTE Confidence: 0.8284164071083069

00:08:26.032 --> 00:08:27.360
thing we get out of Aspire.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8785780668258667

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.950
Let's hit at 5 and we're going to see just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8785780668258667

00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:32.880
how fast we can download this model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7413942813873291

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.254
I shouldn't they they offered me a hard line Internet

NOTE Confidence: 0.7413942813873291

00:08:35.293 --> 00:08:35.720
connection.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7602102160453796

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.880
I was like, Nah, it's fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8576268553733826

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:37.920
So we'll see.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9340795874595642

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.840
We'll see how well this goes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.19065456092357635

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:38.960
It's.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8228737115859985

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.480
Not everybody shut down what you're doing right now, yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8493016362190247

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.360
Stop everyone off the Wi-Fi.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5160659551620483

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.760
It's all good.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7181957960128784

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.960
I the, the, the Quinn model is pretty small.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7246286869049072

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.998
So it's, I think it's only like 800 mega or

NOTE Confidence: 0.7246286869049072

00:08:50.045 --> 00:08:50.519
something.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8250871896743774

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.280
So it shouldn't take too long to download.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8748131990432739

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:55.762
He famously says with like 5 minutes left in the,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8748131990432739

00:08:55.807 --> 00:08:57.559
the time slot that we've got available.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7846342325210571

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.199
All right, so now our, our, our post is starting

NOTE Confidence: 0.7846342325210571

00:09:01.246 --> 00:09:02.039
up at the moment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9434264302253723

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.360
It's about to launch the dashboard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9002900719642639

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.520
We'll see that pop up in a second.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9637032747268677

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.760
Here we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9575589299201965

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.000
We'll see our resources.

NOTE Confidence: 0.922518789768219

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.560
There we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9644879698753357

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.120
We have our model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9522693753242493

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.360
It is downloading not particularly fast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9504740238189697

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.120
That is not a great start.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8807316422462463

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.512
But you, you can see like it's going out and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8807316422462463

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:19.960
doing that whole acquisition process for it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.886949896812439

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.030
So because we just described in in Aspire in code,

NOTE Confidence: 0.886949896812439

00:09:23.091 --> 00:09:25.547
this is all the stuff that we want to do

NOTE Confidence: 0.886949896812439

00:09:25.609 --> 00:09:29.293
that will then come and it'll it'll execute those operations

NOTE Confidence: 0.886949896812439

00:09:29.354 --> 00:09:32.547
for us, bring down that model and it will eventually

NOTE Confidence: 0.886949896812439

00:09:32.609 --> 00:09:33.960
become up and running.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8683903217315674

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.068
We'll also notice that the web application is in a

NOTE Confidence: 0.8683903217315674

00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:37.974
waiting state because we said that we want to wait

NOTE Confidence: 0.8683903217315674

00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:39.319
for that model to become available.

NOTE Confidence: 0.808279812335968

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.697
So this will quite definitely not download in in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.808279812335968

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:48.199
time, but I'm I'm sure you can understand the process.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8477165102958679

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.458
And anyway, the the demo of the application is not

NOTE Confidence: 0.8477165102958679

00:09:50.499 --> 00:09:53.010
particularly exciting because that's not the point of what we

NOTE Confidence: 0.8477165102958679

00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.039
wanted to show off here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8242523074150085

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.812
We weren't showing you how you can build a chat

NOTE Confidence: 0.8242523074150085

00:09:56.869 --> 00:09:58.759
UI for a, A in a web application.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9223800301551819

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.815
It was more how you manage that orchestration in a

NOTE Confidence: 0.9223800301551819

00:10:01.873 --> 00:10:04.999
distributed application design with say Foundry local.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9109902381896973

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.430
So and yeah, I don't think I have another model

NOTE Confidence: 0.9109902381896973

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.240
on here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7934218049049377

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.520
Let's let's just check quickly check.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9271950721740723

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.080
I don't think I do Foundry model list.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6143178939819336

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.040
Wait, no, it's not model list.

NOTE Confidence: 0.2720023989677429

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.600
It's list.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8938337564468384

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.480
Let's see, do I have another model on here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7904363870620728

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:28.480
No, no, it's at one point something percent so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7359484434127808

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.120
So this is actually like what?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8651536703109741

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.718
So behind the scenes what it does is it actually

NOTE Confidence: 0.8651536703109741

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:35.299
uses that SDK from Foundry local and then it it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8651536703109741

00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:37.519
requesting from it to download that model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8629729151725769

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.414
So and then it's it's pulling that to get the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8629729151725769

00:10:39.453 --> 00:10:40.399
progress download of it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7411139607429504

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.480
So here we go.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8580406904220581

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.280
Like is there a small model I can download?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8763119578361511

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.360
No, I think that's the smallest one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.4651208519935608

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:44.960
That's right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.853595495223999

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.480
Yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8733822107315063

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.840
But it's OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8364922404289246

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.458
I mean, we can all come back tomorrow and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8364922404289246

00:10:48.489 --> 00:10:49.600
we'll download it and we'll be fine.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8550320863723755

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.560
We'll just continue from then.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8182893395423889

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.546
Yeah, but behind the scenes, all it is doing is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8182893395423889

00:10:53.598 --> 00:10:56.799
it's it's orchestrating this command line tool anyway for us.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8799023628234863

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.920
Unfortunately, I can't swap that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5421924591064453

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.880
Oh, you only have one because I only have one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8173294067382812

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:10.800
Oh, actually, let's let's see, where is my cable bag?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6029152870178223

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.520
We're looking at it 15%.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9452034831047058

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.760
15% it's going, it's getting there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7121706008911133

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.400
I have, I have a USBC to USBA.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8993757963180542

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.640
Let's see if I can find that one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9049342274665833

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.680
No, let's see if we can.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8739645481109619

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.608
Let's see if we plug in Ethernet and it goes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8739645481109619

00:11:25.647 --> 00:11:26.079
any faster.

NOTE Confidence: 0.942503809928894

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.490
This is how you know you're at the end of

NOTE Confidence: 0.942503809928894

00:11:29.544 --> 00:11:30.999
day three of build is that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8808318972587585

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.795
Yeah, we are just freaking out ever so slightly as

NOTE Confidence: 0.8808318972587585

00:11:34.862 --> 00:11:37.479
our demos do not go quite to plan that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.807945966720581

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.684
No, I like, I don't think that's going to download

NOTE Confidence: 0.807945966720581

00:11:41.736 --> 00:11:42.159
in time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8933520317077637

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.480
Feel free to stick around.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7823694944381714

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.728
We'll, we'll jump off to the side if you want

NOTE Confidence: 0.7823694944381714

00:11:44.756 --> 00:11:44.840
to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8794713020324707

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.408
If you want to see proof that this does work,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8794713020324707

00:11:47.465 --> 00:11:49.519
I'm more than more than happy to do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7173445820808411

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.520
Oh, no, no, there we.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6444470882415771

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:50.880
Go now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.834737241268158

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.580
I want to say one of the cool things here

NOTE Confidence: 0.834737241268158

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:54.736
is that you didn't specify what version of the Quen

NOTE Confidence: 0.834737241268158

00:11:54.777 --> 00:11:55.400
model you want.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8105942010879517

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.336
You didn't say I want this to run the GPU

NOTE Confidence: 0.8105942010879517

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.273
or the CPU, and you just said I want the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8105942010879517

00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.840
Quen model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9128438234329224

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.120
Go figure it out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8369284868240356

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.720
Like what's going to work on this device?

NOTE Confidence: 0.6830722093582153

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.600
Right, yeah.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8640809059143066

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.747
And and because I'm running on my laptop, it doesn't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8640809059143066

00:12:05.787 --> 00:12:06.760
have an MPU in this one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.937414288520813

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.080
I don't have a powerful GPU.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9281067252159119

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.491
So it's figured out to download the the CPU version

NOTE Confidence: 0.9281067252159119

00:12:11.558 --> 00:12:11.959
of it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8844338059425354

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.862
And that's where like if we go back back up,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8844338059425354

00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:17.039
the, the one that I deleted was.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8489490747451782

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.760
So that was from when I practiced this demo beforehand.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88813716173172

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.291
So it was the CPU version of that model that

NOTE Confidence: 0.88813716173172

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:24.319
that had previously been downloaded.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910744786262512

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.818
But yeah, it's it's going, it probably won't hit before

NOTE Confidence: 0.8910744786262512

00:12:27.882 --> 00:12:29.600
the end of our two minutes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9586278796195984

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.240
But thank you for joining us there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9330270886421204

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.018
There is only so much juggling I can do to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9330270886421204

00:12:35.061 --> 00:12:36.839
get us through to the end of this session.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9212555885314941

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.400
But I hope you've enjoyed build.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8665938973426819

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.480
I hope you enjoyed this session.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8315503001213074

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.367
And do come over and see us at the side

NOTE Confidence: 0.8315503001213074

00:12:41.405 --> 00:12:43.082
if you want to see proof in the pudding that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8315503001213074

00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:43.960
it does actually work.
