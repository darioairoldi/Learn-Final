This video demonstrates how to build a **4S 1P lithium-ion battery pack** using **Samsung 30T 21700** cells. 
The creator uses a **spot welder** to **connect the cells in series**, and **3D printed end caps** and spacers to **hold the pack together**. 
They also **discuss the importance of using balance wires** and discharge wires to ensure the pack functions correctly.

DISCLAIMER - lithium batteries are very dangerous if mistreated, take it slow & do plenty of research before working with them!

The **spot welder** is the **Sequre SQ-SW1** (also sold as the Flipsky FS-SW1) running from a Turnigy Rapid 5500mAh 3S2P 140C hardcase lipo, settings in the video **were 40ms with 20% preheat** & the **nickel strip is 0.2mm** pure/solid nickel (*not* nickel plated steel).

The cells are **Samsung INR21700-30T**, you can read a proper review on lygte-info.dk -

3D printed end caps came from Thingiverse, there are a bunch of designs to choose from. 
Remember you can use a **18650 design for 21700 cells** if you just play with the scale!
