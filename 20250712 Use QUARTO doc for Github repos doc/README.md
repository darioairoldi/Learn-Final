## Overview

**Quarto** is a powerful, **open-source** **scientific** and **technical publishing system** that allows you to create beautiful documentation websites from Markdown files.<br>
When combined with **GitHub Pages**, it provides an excellent solution for publishing and maintaining project documentation.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Project Structure

Quarto is highly flexible and supports multiple project structures. Here are several common approaches:

#### Standard Documentation Structure

A typical Quarto documentation project follows this structure:

```text
your-repo/
├── src/
│   └── doc/           # Source markdown files
│       ├── index.md
│       ├── guide.md
│       └── reference.md
├── docs/              # Rendered HTML output (for GitHub Pages)
├── _quarto.yml        # Quarto configuration file
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── quarto-publish.yml  # GitHub Actions workflow
```

#### Root-Level Structure

For simpler projects, you can place content directly in the root:

```text
your-repo/
├── index.md           # Homepage
├── guide.md           # Documentation pages
├── reference.md
├── about.md
├── docs/              # Rendered output
├── _quarto.yml        # Configuration
└── images/            # Assets
```

#### Learn Repository Structure Example

For a repository like your "Learn" repo with existing folder structure, you could adapt it as follows:

```text
Learn/                              # Your existing repository
├── index.md                        # New: Main landing page
├── _quarto.yml                     # New: Quarto configuration
├── docs/                           # New: Rendered output
├── 202506 Build 2025/              # Existing: Event documentation
│   ├── index.md                    # New: Build 2025 overview
│   ├── BRK106/
│   │   └── *.md                    # Existing: Session notes
│   └── BRK122/
│       └── *.md                    # Existing: Session notes
├── 20250702 Azure Naming conventions/  # Existing: Topic folder
│   └── *.md                        # Existing: Content
├── 20250704 TableStorageAccess options/  # Existing: Topic folder
│   └── *.md                        # Existing: Content
└── _ISSUES/                        # Existing: Issue tracking
    └── */                          # Existing: Issue folders
```

#### Multi-Section Structure

For larger documentation sites with distinct sections:

```text
your-repo/
├── index.md
├── _quarto.yml
├── docs/              # Rendered output
├── tutorials/         # Tutorial section
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── getting-started.md
│   └── advanced.md
├── reference/         # Reference section
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── api.md
│   └── cli.md
├── blog/              # Blog section (optional)
│   ├── index.md
│   └── posts/
└── assets/            # Shared resources
    ├── images/
    └── styles/
```

### 2. Configuration File (`_quarto.yml`)

The `_quarto.yml` file is the heart of your Quarto project configuration:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs

website:
  title: "Your Documentation"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: guide.qmd
        text: Guide
      - href: reference.qmd
        text: Reference

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

### 3. Source Directory (`src/doc/`)

- **Purpose**: Contains your source Markdown (`.md`) or Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) files
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use clear, descriptive filenames
  - Organize content hierarchically with subdirectories
  - Include an `index.md` as your homepage
  - Use consistent front matter (YAML headers)

### 4. Output Directory (`docs/`)

- **Purpose**: Contains the rendered HTML files that GitHub Pages will serve
- **Important Notes**:
  - This directory is generated by Quarto's rendering process
  - Should be included in your repository for GitHub Pages
  - Configure GitHub Pages to serve from the `/docs` folder

## Setting Up Quarto with GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Initialize Quarto Project

```bash
# In your repository root
quarto create-project . --type website
```

### Step 2: Configure Output Directory

Ensure your `_quarto.yml` specifies the correct output directory:

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs  # GitHub Pages will serve from here
```

### Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository's Settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Set Source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select branch: `main` (or your default branch)
5. Select folder: `/docs`

### Step 4: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml`:

```yaml
name: Render and Publish Quarto Documentation

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Set up Quarto
      uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
      
    - name: Render Quarto Project
      run: quarto render
      
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./docs
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Content Organization

- **Logical Structure**: Organize content by topic or user journey
- **Navigation**: Use clear, hierarchical navigation in your `_quarto.yml`
- **Cross-References**: Leverage Quarto's cross-referencing capabilities
- **Index Pages**: Create overview pages for each section

### 2. Writing Guidelines

- **Front Matter**: Use YAML front matter for metadata:

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Page Title"
  description: "Brief description"
  date: "2025-01-14"
  ---
  ```

- **Code Blocks**: Use syntax highlighting and proper language specification
- **Images**: Store images in organized subdirectories, use relative paths
- **Links**: Use relative links for internal navigation

### 3. Development Workflow

1. **Write**: Create/edit Markdown files in `src/doc/`
2. **Preview**: Use `quarto preview` for local development
3. **Render**: Run `quarto render` to generate HTML
4. **Commit**: Add both source and rendered files to Git
5. **Push**: GitHub Actions will handle deployment

### 4. Version Control Considerations

- **Include Rendered Files**: Unlike some static site generators, include the `docs/` folder in version control
- **Ignore Temporary Files**: Add to `.gitignore`:

  ```text
  .quarto/
  /.quarto/
  ```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Themes and Styling

- **Built-in Themes**: Choose from cosmo, flatly, darkly, etc.
- **Custom CSS**: Add custom styling via CSS files
- **SCSS Variables**: Customize theme variables

### 2. Interactive Content

- **Code Execution**: Embed executable code blocks
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Include `.ipynb` files directly
- **Observable JS**: Add interactive visualizations

### 3. Multi-language Support

- **Code Highlighting**: Support for numerous programming languages
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language documentation support

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. GitHub Pages Not Updating

- Check that the `docs/` folder is being committed
- Verify GitHub Pages is configured to serve from `/docs`
- Ensure GitHub Actions workflow is running successfully

### 2. Broken Links

- Use relative paths for internal links
- Test all links before publishing
- Use Quarto's link checking capabilities

### 3. Rendering Errors

- Check `_quarto.yml` syntax
- Verify all referenced files exist
- Review console output for specific error messages

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Analytics

- Add Google Analytics or similar tracking
- Monitor page views and user behavior
- Use GitHub Insights for repository metrics

### 2. Content Updates

- Regular review of documentation accuracy
- Update dependencies and links
- Maintain consistent style and formatting

### 3. Performance

- Optimize images for web delivery
- Minimize custom CSS and JavaScript
- Monitor page load times

## Conclusion
